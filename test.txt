404.suggester.py is one of the most important site scripts and underpins the uniqueness of the site. 
We are going to completelyh rework 404-suggester.py I want everything organized into neat functions, using the 
suckless programming style. I want you to create a api route for 404-suggester itself to pull data from the needed json files 

and for routes it will need to know every page app. This is easy for the standard / roues for pages like /grid for ex. 
but for post pages, category pages, and tag pages you will need to go ahead and check the .json files for that directory.  
for ex. for essays 
go to data/essays and it will need to take in essays.json, tags.json and categories.json from the data/essays directory and understand 
the structure of those 3 types of files as it will be the same process for all the routes in (content) directory.
