> ok great at this point lets go ahead and perform tasks6.md and content.db should be held inside of data so data/content.db and proceed to
delete the .json files when the db is completed. upon creating the db i want a content.go in /scripts that can read the db and list
information out to a termianl user interface such as all of the tags, all of the categories, all the notes or all of the essays, ect.

> and in addition to that for duplicate categories and tags they all seem exactly the same so stick with the first on in the db and just
refuse any duplicates
