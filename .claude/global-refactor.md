# On Vibe Coding
----------------------
This site was originally vibe coded via vercel. I swapped over to vscode and started to actually look at the code, project structure, data flow, ect. even though I did not write any code. So I have a great understanding of most of this project. 
I however still dont understand at the code i.e. level of functions, ect. what is going on. I need to fix this. So I will be 
taking some time away for krisyotam.com, possibly around 2 months. 

# What Will I be doing in the meantime? 
-----------------------
In the meantime I will progressively learn html, css, js, react, next as well as all the additional things like project structure, 
proper git management, apis, ect. In order to create a more beneficial relationshiop between me and ai. Allowing me to fully comprehend all the code in the project and shift to the more meaningul task of producing it myself except for in repetivie structures offloading that work to a trusted assistant i.e. you claude. 


# Your Goals in the meantime
-----------------------
In the meantime you can assume when I am back I will be junior dev level which is fine. I have a IQ of rougly 145 on the low side and I am naturally a fast learner. I will be at senior levels of understanding fast as I will pay for tutoring code review, ect. 
I have decided to go all in on full stack web development so there's that. I want you to prepare this repo for me. The main tasks will be identifying the weaknesses that I need to begin fixing when I get back. Giving ALL files a File header so that in the event a file is archived or removed we know exactly where it was maintained.
