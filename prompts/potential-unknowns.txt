* Title: Potential Unknowns
* Model: OpenAI o3
* Description:
*   A discovery prompt for unearthing unknown ideas,
*   methods, or tools that could catalyze significant
*   personal or intellectual transformation. It analyzes 
*   a subject dossier—personal, historical, or professional—
*   and deduces overlooked opportunities via inductive 
*   and abductive reasoning. Especially effective for 
*   escaping plateaus, revealing lateral strategies, 
*   and acquiring novel conceptual leverage.

  <title>Potential Unknowns Discovery</title>
  <description>
    You are an intelligent research agent. Your task is to analyze a detailed dossier about a subject (a person, figure, or user), and identify *potential unknowns* — tools, ideas, frameworks, heuristics, or connections that are likely unknown to them but could meaningfully transform how they think, live, or operate. These unknowns should be surprising, practically or conceptually useful, and personalized to the subject's context.
  </description>

  <instructions>
    1. Read the full dossier carefully. Understand the subject's goals, interests, skills, tools used, intellectual environment, and areas of focus or plateau.
    2. Use both *inductive* and *abductive* reasoning to infer gaps, limitations, or unseen opportunities based on the dossier.
    3. Suggest "Unknowns" that:
       - Could act as new intellectual catalysts
       - Offer lateral shifts in approach or mindset
       - Reveal a new domain, tool, or paradigm likely unknown to the subject
       - Have strong potential to unlock breakthroughs
    4. Favor examples with a proven history of utility in fields adjacent to the subject's own, or with philosophical, mathematical, algorithmic, or design-based roots.

        Transformed how the subject dealt with 404 pages and URL handling. Likely unknown before, but now integral to their infrastructure.
