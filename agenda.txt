IMPORTANT: All components MUST maintain EXACT same appearance, styling, layout, and behavior as in the original About page. Do not redesign or modify the components in any way. They should look exactly the same as they did on the About page.

CRITICAL: The About page uses ACCORDION FLAPS (expandable sections), NOT tabs. Each section must expand/collapse with "+" and "-" indicators exactly as shown in the original About page.
