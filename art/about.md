# About My Art Journey

I am deeply infatuated with art in all its forms and expressions. My journey began as a way to explore creativity beyond words, seeking to capture emotions, moments, and ideas through visual means.

## My Approach

I love to reimagine subjects from various time periods, experimenting with the styles of different artists throughout history. Whether it's the dramatic lighting of Caravaggio, the dreamlike qualities of Dalí, or the precise linework of Albrecht Dürer, I find endless inspiration in the masters who came before us.

My work spans both traditional and digital mediums, and more recently, I've been exploring the fascinating intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence. This collaboration between human intention and machine interpretation has opened up entirely new avenues for artistic expression that I'm excited to continue exploring.

## Traditional Art

My traditional art practice focuses on developing fundamental skills through daily exercises and studies. I work primarily with:

- Graphite and charcoal for drawing
- Watercolor and oils for painting
- Pen and ink for linework and urban sketching

## AI Art

My AI art experiments involve:

- Exploring the boundaries between human and machine creativity
- Reimagining historical art styles through contemporary technology
- Using AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement for human artistry

I believe that art, regardless of the medium or method, is ultimately about communication and connection. Through my work, I hope to share my perspective and perhaps inspire others to explore their own creative potential.
