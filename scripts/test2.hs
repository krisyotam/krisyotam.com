{- Local Mirror design: <https://gwern.net/archiving#preemptive-local-archiving>

Because link rot has proven difficult to keep up with on `gwern.net` using [ordinary reactive link
archiving methods](https://gwern.net/archiving), I am switching to *pre-emptive archiving*:
for most external links on Gwern.net, they will now point to a local (stored on Gwern.net) mirror of
the original external link as the default. As the cost of disk/bandwidth falls while the value of
human attention increases, if something is worth linking, it is worth hosting—assuming good tooling.
The local mirror will be a self-contained static HTML copy which cannot linkrot (unless Gwern.net
itself goes down in which case the issue is largely moot). The local mirrors will, aside from being
infinitely more reliable, also be faster for the reader to load & browse, as they will be loaded
from the current domain's CDN and are the final DOMs saved using adblock etc (benefiting the large
fraction of Gwern.net readers who do not have ad blockers installed).

The implementation strategy is, similar to the [link
popups](https://gwern.net/static/build/LinkMetadata.hs), a Pandoc Hakyll plugin which at
Markdown → HTML compile-time traverses the Markdown AST for non-whitelisted external links, looks
for a local mirror of each one, create a local mirror via SingleFile
(https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile/) if necessary, and rewrites the link to point to the
local mirror.

Details:

- at compile-time, [`hakyll.hs`](https://gwern.net/static/build/hakyll.hs) reads the local
  database, and feeds it into a `localizeLink` function which walks the Pandoc AST and processes all
  external links
- mirror metadata is stored in a local database (a Haskell association list read in as a
  [`Data.Map`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.4.0.0/docs/Data-Map.html) for now,
  like the popup previews) with the schema: `(URL, MIRROR_FILE, FIRST_SEEN, MIRRORED_SUCCESSFULLY)`
- links are checked against a whitelist of domains to exclude, where mirroring is either unnecessary
  or undesirable: arxiv.org, Wikipedia, Gwern.net, lesswrong.com, HN, Nature, Youtube etc. (Primary
  exclusion reasons: services, interactive pages, pages which are too hard to snapshot, pages which
  are too large due to inline media, domains which are stable & not at linkrot risk, pages which are
  inherently updated frequently & archiving is not helpful.)
- links are only mirrored _n_ days after first being seen, giving them time to reach a finalized
  form (eg. blog post discussions); if there is no entry in the database, one is made with the
  current date as `FIRST_SEEN` and the link is skipped; if an entry with `FIRST_SEEN` exists and the
  current date is ≥ _n_ days later and `MIRROR_FILE` does not exist, then unless `Failed` is false
  (indicating the previous mirror attempt failed and it's probably a permanently broken link which
  must be updated manually), it is mirrored and rewritten, otherwise, just rewritten

    - Only a few URLs should be mirrored each time. Simply downloading *all* links turns out to have
      a lot of undesired consequences: bulk-adds of PDFs will trigger anti-bot defenses & corrupt PDFs
      requiring extremely labor-intensive checks & repairs; and manual review of a dozen simultaneous
      HTML snapshots can come at unwelcome, stressed-out times (which is _muri_).
- mirrors are made using SingleFile, which runs Chromium to serialize a DOM

    - PDFs are just downloaded unconditionally because they are so easy to archive
    - Why SingleFile instead of Chromium's screenshot mode, which is built-in & easy to use? Because
      Chromium screenshot mode is deliberately crippled and will never support extensions or
      cookies. Why do I want mirroring to be done with extensions & cookies? I want extensions
      because if I don't use uBlock, the mirrored versions will be stuffed full of malware, tracking
      code, and ads; and if I don't use a 'kill sticky' extension, thousands of mirrored pages will
      have giant "Please click here to accept cookies / GDPR / sign up for our newsletter /
      ill-thought-through floating-headers" obscuring the entire page. (I won't use NoScript because
      in whitelist mode, NoScript breaks a large fraction of all websites currently, and going
      through and adding the necessary whitelists is infeasible; I have to rely on uBlock to get rid
      of bad JS.) And I want cookies because this allows cookies for logins (eg. subreddits marked
      NSFW like the darknet market ones) rather than archiving useless login wall pages.
- mirrors are saved to `wiki/doc/www/$DOMAIN($URL)/SHA1($URL).html`; the additional nesting by
  domain name is necessary to allow CSS link annotations to match rewritten links

    - `/doc/www/` is excluded from the `sitemap.xml` & `sync-gwern.net` compile-time checks,
      blocked in `robots.txt`, `rel="canonical"` is set in the mirrors by SingleFile,
      additional`rel="archive nofollow"` attributes are set on each link when used in Gwern.net, and
      noarchive/noindex/nofollow/nocache are set as HTTP headers by nginx for `/doc/www/`; exposing
      thousands of mirrors to the rest of the Internet risks causing SEO issues, high bandwidth
      consumption, and legal or social problems
- links are rewritten to point the `href` to `wiki/doc/www/$DOMAIN($URL)/SHA1($URL).html`; like
  inflation-adjustments or link popups, the original `href` is stored as a span (eg. `<a
  href="https://foo.com">foo</a>` → `<a rel="archive nofollow" data-url-original="https://foo.com"
  href="/doc/www/foo.com/cf934d97a8012ba1c2d354d6cd39e77535fd0fb9.html">foo</a></span>`)

  WARNING: the details here are in flux, as we try to eliminate linkrot/external links by linking
  local archives where they exist, but we also want to avoid users copy-pasting those URLs rather
  than the original, canonical URLs. (The local archive URLs are fragile and cause other problems;
  for example, they make my writing a lot harder as I can no longer search using a URL I right-click
  because all of the references in Markdown or annotations will be to the original URL, not the current
  local archive in `/doc/www/`.) Our current attempt as of April 2025 is to link in the HTML source to the
  local archive, `href=archive`, but then on page load, the links will be rewritten by JS to `href=original`.
  This should in theory give the best of both worlds.
- the `data-url-original` metadata is used by `popups.js` to add to link popups a '[original]'
  hyperlink (using the JS templating, something like `<p>…"Title" [<a
  href="${target.dataset.urlOriginal}" title="Original (live) Internet version of
  ${target.dataset.popupTitle}">original</a>]…</p>`)

There are approximately 30k external links on Gwern.net as of October 2019, of which perhaps 5k need
to be mirrored; I estimate this will take up somewhere on the order of ~50GB and add a few dollars
to S3 hosting costs. (After exclusions, my archive was 5,300 links (excluding optional PDFs) / 20GB
in February 2020. It has grown to 14,352 / 47G as of 2023-03-09.) But it'll be worth it to forestall
thousands of dying links, regular reader frustration, and a considerable waste of my time every month
dealing with the latest broken links. -}
