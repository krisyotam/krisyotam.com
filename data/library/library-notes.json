      "content": "I recently came to discover my perennial disdain for annotations was likely due to the immensely expensive (for a book that is) collectors editions I own. To offset this I will be moving to performing my literary analysis in books again except this type with penguin classics. They are cheap, feel good in the hand, and have ravishing cover art. They make the annotations themselves a addition rather than a impediment."
