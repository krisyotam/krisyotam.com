      "Most Eminent and Reverend Lords of the Holy Office, I, Galileo Galilei, stand before you today not as an enemy of faith but as its servant, who believes that the same God who endowed us with senses, reason, and intellect intended us to use them in understanding His creation.",
      "I have been charged with holding and defending the proposition that the Earth moves and is not the center of the universe. You have deemed this view contrary to Scripture. With the deepest respect for your authority in matters of faith, I must explain why I believe there is no contradiction between the Copernican system and proper understanding of Holy Scripture.",
      "When Scripture speaks of astronomical matters, it accommodates itself to the common understanding and language of the people. Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, not because the sun moves around the Earth, but because this expresses what appears to human perception. Scripture's purpose is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go.",
      "The book of nature, which God has written in mathematical language, reveals truths through careful observation and reasoned analysis. My telescope has shown mountains on the moon, phases of Venus, and satellites orbiting Jupiterâ€”all supporting the Copernican view and contradicting the Aristotelian cosmology long assumed to align with Scripture.",
      "I do not set myself up as an interpreter of Scripture. That sacred task belongs to the Church. But I humbly suggest that in matters of natural philosophy, God's creation itself must inform our understanding of His word. When demonstrable physical facts appear to contradict a particular interpretation of Scripture, prudence suggests we reconsider the interpretation, not deny the evidence before our eyes.",
      "Some fear that acknowledging the Earth's motion diminishes human importance in creation. I believe the opposite. Understanding our true place in the cosmos only increases our wonder at the Creator's majesty. The Earth's status as one planet among many does not reduce its spiritual significance, just as a man's humility before God does not diminish but enhances his dignity.",
      "I have never intended to challenge the authority of the Church, which I have served faithfully throughout my life. If my writings have given that impression, I deeply regret it. I seek only to fulfill my obligation as a philosopher: to investigate the constitution of the universe that the Creator has placed before our eyes.",
      "Whatever your judgment, I will accept it with the submission proper to a faithful son of the Church. Yet I cannot, in good conscience, deny what observation and demonstration have revealed to me. For in the words of Cardinal Baronius, the Holy Spirit teaches us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."
