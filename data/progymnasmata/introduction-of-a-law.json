      "Citizens of our republic, I come before you to propose a law establishing a Universal Basic Income—a regular financial stipend provided to every adult citizen regardless of employment status or income level. This proposal responds to profound economic and technological changes that require new approaches to ensuring the welfare and dignity of all members of our society.",
      "The necessity of this law arises from several converging developments. First, technological automation continues to eliminate traditional employment across multiple sectors, from manufacturing to services to knowledge work. While creating new opportunities, this transformation leaves many workers permanently displaced. Second, our current social support systems, designed for an industrial economy with stable, long-term employment, increasingly fail to provide adequate security in an era of gig work, frequent career changes, and structural unemployment. Third, rising wealth inequality threatens both economic stability and democratic governance, as an increasing share of resources concentrates among a diminishing percentage of the population.",
      "The proposed law would establish a monthly payment to every adult citizen, set initially at a level sufficient to meet basic needs while maintaining incentives for productive contribution. This payment would replace certain existing welfare programs while complementing others, simplifying administration while providing a more reliable safety net. Funding would come from a combination of sources, including a modest tax on financial transactions, a carbon fee that simultaneously addresses environmental concerns, and the redirection of funds from obsolete programs.",
      "The benefits of this law would be substantial and wide-ranging. For individuals, it would provide economic security that enhances freedom—freedom to pursue education, care for family members, start businesses, or accept meaningful work that might otherwise be financially impractical. For communities, it would stimulate local economies through increased consumer spending and support volunteer activities that build social capital. For the broader economy, it would maintain consumer demand in the face of technological unemployment and reduce the economic damage caused by poverty and financial stress.",
      "Critics may raise legitimate concerns about cost, work incentives, and implementation challenges. These deserve serious consideration. However, evidence from pilot programs in various jurisdictions suggests that universal basic income does not significantly reduce work effort, particularly when set at an appropriate level. The costs, while substantial, represent not new expenditure but largely a reallocation of existing social welfare spending. And while implementation presents logistical challenges, these are manageable with modern financial technology and administrative systems.",
      "The justice of this proposal rests on fundamental principles shared across the political spectrum. For conservatives, it represents a more efficient, less bureaucratic approach to social welfare that respects individual choice and responsibility. For progressives, it addresses structural inequality and recognizes the dignity and worth of all citizens regardless of market value. For all, it acknowledges our shared stake in an economy increasingly shaped by technological forces beyond individual control.",
      "Fellow citizens, the time has come to adapt our economic institutions to the realities of the twenty-first century. By establishing a Universal Basic Income, we can create a foundation of economic security that enables all members of our society to participate meaningfully in our common life, contribute their unique talents, and pursue their conception of a good life with dignity and freedom. I urge your support for this necessary and forward-looking legislation."
