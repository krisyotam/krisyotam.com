      "Socrates, when declared by the Oracle of Delphi to be the wisest man in Athens, remarked, \"I know that I know nothing.\" This paradoxical statement reveals the foundation of true wisdom.",
      "The saying deserves praise for its profound humility. In a city filled with sophists who claimed expertise in all matters, Socrates stood apart by acknowledging the limits of human understanding. This intellectual honesty elevated him above those who mistook confidence for knowledge.",
      "To paraphrase this wisdom: True understanding begins with recognizing the boundaries of one's knowledge. The moment we believe ourselves complete in our learning is the moment we cease to learn at all.",
      "By comparison, consider Protagoras who claimed, \"Man is the measure of all things.\" While this celebrates human reason, it lacks the humility that makes Socrates' approach so valuable. Socrates understood that human measure is inherently limited.",
      "An example that illustrates this wisdom can be found in Socrates' method of questioning. By systematically revealing the contradictions in others' thinking, he demonstrated how presumed knowledge often collapses under scrutiny.",
      "Testimonies from others support this view. Plato recorded how even the most confident interlocutors were reduced to aporia—a state of puzzlement—after Socratic examination. This was not mere rhetorical victory but a demonstration of how recognizing ignorance is the first step toward genuine inquiry.",
      "I conclude that Socrates' acknowledgment of his ignorance was not false modesty but the cornerstone of his philosophical method. By knowing that he did not know, he created space for questions rather than premature answers. In our age of information abundance and opinion overload, this ancient wisdom remains profoundly relevant."
