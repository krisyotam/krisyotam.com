      "In the warmth of summer, a Grasshopper chirped and danced in the fields. He was having a wonderful time, hopping about and singing to his heart's content.",
      "Meanwhile, an Ant passed by, carrying a large kernel of corn to his nest. The Grasshopper watched as the Ant toiled, day after day, collecting food and storing it away.",
      "\"Why do you work so hard?\" asked the Grasshopper. \"Come and chat with me instead of toiling and moiling in that way.\"",
      "\"I am storing food for the winter,\" said the Ant, \"and I recommend you do the same.\"",
      "\"Why bother about winter?\" said the Grasshopper. \"We have plenty of food at present.\" The Ant went on his way, continuing his work.",
      "When winter came, the Grasshopper found himself dying of hunger while watching the Ants distribute corn and grain from their stores each day.",
      "Then the Grasshopper understood: it is best to prepare for the days of necessity."
