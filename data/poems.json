    "stanza1": "Lo, death rises upon an altar!\nacting as the eternal exalter—\namidst the virgin in the dust.\nWhere the jailed and the jailor and the small and the great—\nall eat off a eternal plate.",
    "stanza2": "Here lie palaces of old, gilded manors, and halls—\nwhere the privileged few threw many balls.\nCities that scrape the sky, lights without suns shine—\nwhere they dine upon swine, and wine.",
    "stanza3": "There is food without the hunt;\nTravel atop undead beasts that roar.\nCommunion without a breath—\nthat lends itself to intangible wars—\nthat are fought without scores.",
    "stanza4": "Though they praise freedom, they create slaves.\nthey cast a shadow, and curse not the source.\nO Death! where is your strength? O Virgin Daughter, where is your crown?\nYour strength is the grave; and your crown ground to dust.",
    "stanza5": "But Lo! I feel thunder in the air.\nthe heavens I sense a movement their.\nThe sky cracked like a sheet of glass—\nand yielded not to the upper class.\nRed rivers flow forth and The dams burst as if told.",
    "stanza6": "out the west arises hell from a pit below\nquickly coming to quench it’s eternal woe"
