# Opening Remarks 
This villanelle is one of my first attempts at writing a villanelle since highschool. It is inspired by the idea of time, and the way humans fundamentally perceive it. 
People overestimate what they can do in a day, and underestimate what they can do in a year. 

# Opening Line
To start our iambic flow, I chose the line "I learned to lie by listening to clocks".
