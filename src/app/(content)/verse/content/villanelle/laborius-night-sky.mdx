Under the cover of night
Shine solus beings dethroned,
If only you knew you weren't alone.

Your redemption lamented,
Tehom says attest to the harshness,
Confined to a precinct of darkness.

Sloane's machinate propaganda,
There ruthless starkness strikes home,
If only you knew you weren't alone.

Your concealment carried out,
You lie harmless but obnoxious,
Confined to a precinct of darkness.

Your pain forgotten,
Through time neglected,
If only you knew you weren't alone.

You are forever bound,
Your freedom compound,
Confined to a precinct of darkness.
