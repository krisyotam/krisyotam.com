You the guard of the abyss
You who vitiates the sins of the sacrilegious
You the one who's laugh like quicksand
Coagulates those who stand testament against
God
You who is abaddon angel of sheol
The one who resides above the orthoptera
Keyholder of the bottomless pit
Approbation for the destroyer!
Reverence for abbadon!
