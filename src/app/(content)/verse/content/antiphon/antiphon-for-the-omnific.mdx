You, the adamantine forgiver, the one whose
love never flees.
You, the intransigent judge of the delinquent
and prosecutor of the reprehensible.

You are EL-ELYON — the Highest,

The One whose throne rests in the 7th heaven,

The One whose ordinance is steadfast.

Praise to Attiq Youm!
Praise to the Ancient One!
