Once lush, and vibrant
a inspiration for–
all within reach
to chasten the masses

Now forsaken, you lie
slain from the root
by the grave even the-
graceful lie destitute

a martyr by the flame
a soul forfeited by fame
as you cling to this
zero-sum game

your radiant petals
muted
a salient spirit
rooted
