The Child who just received a nintendo
switch for her 8th birthday

The man who had to hitch a ride home only
to find his mother's death

The piquant taste of sugar straight from the
cane

The same sugar that leaves 88 thousand slain

A mundane day of tedious tasks
Not knowing that somewhere else is a
person's last

The freedom of a deer with the world to
explore

Its life stripped away by a lion's vigor

We all think we see the big picture
But the pieces are scattered in the sand
Only time will reveal what we understand
