# ==============================================================================

I have forsaken my passion,
and my passion has forsaken me.

I grieve,
but my tears fail to fall.

I've given up,
yet my body continues to move.

This silent body
houses a screaming soul.

My skin is warm,
yet I cannot stop shivering.

My heart races,
but my hands remain still.

Surrounded by love—
that fails to surround me.
