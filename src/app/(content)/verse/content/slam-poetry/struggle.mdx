Wake up, eat, sleep, repeat.
Wake up, eat, sleep, repeat.
Wake up, eat, sleep, repeat.

Every day's a gray pebble on a gravel path,
My future subject to the devil's wrath.

Hope—forget hope.

If I had a dollar for every time I hoped,
Then I'd be broke.

Oh wait—broke. I am broke,
Almost like my wallet had a stroke.

But scream—scream at me some more,
As if I like standing by while my destiny gets choked,
While I stay cloaked.

Now you've got me provoked.

Four-fourths of my life spent a slave—
If only I could rent freedom for a day,
I'd stay away.

Away from that ravenous wolf,
Away from that venomous snake,
While desire pursues me like fleeting fire.

Once, I carried a thorn in my side,
Now, I'm a battered vase inside.

Sometimes you must get shattered
To let the light abide.
