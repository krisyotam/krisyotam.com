<Excerpt title="The Vanity of Human Wishes (1749)" author="Samuel Johnson">
The poets who flourished before us found protection in the bosoms of the great and drew from thence the recompense of
their labors. Under such patronage, they were enabled to turn from sordid cares and devote their hours to learning. 
Genius is a plant which thrives only in the sunshine of favor; it withers exposed to want. The shepherd and poet alike 
have found shelter in the shade of the great, where munificence gives genius time to mature.
</Excerpt>

I'm an applied researcher who specializes in [the avant-garde](). My research abounds in several disciplines and often 
culminates on the intersection of two paradoxically analogus topics. I am serious about several forms of writing including 
technical, literary essays, reviews (literature, cinema, music), investigative journalism, genre fiction (micro, flash, novellas), and various forms of verse. 
I am pursuing a vast set of knowledge both wide, and deep with the hopes of having a unique enough skillset to spend my later 
years of contributing to some of the areas I view the most important in my limited world view. Mainly those involving the 
education of young children, and the refinement of education skills into adulthood as well as forming a slow academic lifestyle. 
I am also fairly interested in the development of world religions, (stress, and it's affects on memory and sleep), and a great deal 
of more philosophical questions such as the "why"? behind the continuation of humanity.

<Excerpt title="The Plan of an English Dictionary (1747)" author="Samuel Johnson">
How far this unexpected distinction can be rated among the happy incidents of life, I am not yet able to determine.
Its first effect has been to make me anxious lest it should fix the attention of the public too much upon me, and as
it once happened to an epic poet of France, by raising the reputation of the attempt, obstruct the reception of the work.
I imagine what the world will expect from a scheme, prosecuted under your Lordship’s influence, and I know that
expectation, when her wings are once expanded, easily reaches heights which performance never will attain, and when she
has mounted the summit of perfection, derides her follower, who dies in the pursuit.
