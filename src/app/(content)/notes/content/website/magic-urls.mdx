<Box>
Magic URLs is a feature developed in tandem with [Ally Taffet](). magic-urls.js manages the universal slugs for all 
content on the site, making sure each slug is unique, and accessible. If content is moved, magic-urls.js will take care 
of rerouting the old url to the new one, ensuring that all links remain functional regardless of changes to the category
done in routes such as /notes/category/slug or /essays/category/slug.
