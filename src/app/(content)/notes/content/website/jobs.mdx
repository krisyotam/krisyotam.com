<Box>As I've been thinking about the future of this site, and what is important to me I've been debating help. Is it necessary? 
I've come more or less to the conclusion that yes at some point in order to keep up the output I would like to have across several domains 
in the future help will be needed. Most of these jobs won't be to difficult, and definitely nothing full-time, except maybe 1 position that 
could possibly at some point come close to that.</Box>
