# Introduction 
Here I will be keeping a list of all the TryHackMe rooms I have completed, along with a link to the writeups I have written for them. I may only write up challenge rooms, and 
I may add notes to tutorial rooms, explanatory rooms, and other rooms if I find that necessary. There are a limited amount of friend slots on tryhackme so if you are requesting 
just keep that in my mind. My profile can be viewed [here](https://tryhackme.com/p/khr1st). For easier access to all of the writeups simply look at krisyotam.com/notes/tryhackme
If any tooling/scripts were created for the room, I will link them in the writeup. They will be all be stored in [github.com/krisyotam/tryhackme](https://github.com/krisyotam/tryhackme).
