Since I first began using the internet seriously in my teenage years, YouTube has played a central role in how I’ve explored the world. 
It was my university, my cinema, my news outlet, and occasionally, my escape. Over the years, I transitioned from a passive viewer to a more 
conscious curator—carefully pruning the channels I follow based on intellectual merit, aesthetic value, technical depth, or sheer creative 
brilliance. Now, as I pursue a more intentional and focused digital life, this post is a living record of the YouTube channels I subscribe to,
 organized by category, and updated as my tastes evolve.

- [3Blue1Brown](/link-or-placeholder) - A channel that uses beautiful animations to explain complex mathematical concepts in an intuitive way.

- [Mathologer](/link-or-placeholder) - A channel that delves into the beauty and intricacies of mathematics, often focusing on topics that are not commonly covered in traditional curricula.
