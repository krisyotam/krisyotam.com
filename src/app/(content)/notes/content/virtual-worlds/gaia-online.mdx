## Interactive Family Tree Component Demo

Here's a demonstration of my interactive family tree component, showcasing the Rothschild banking dynasty:

<Tree family="rothschild" />

This component features:
- **Compact preview mode** with expandable tree view
- **Interactive family member cards** with detailed biographical information
- **Relationship navigation** between parents, spouses, and children
- **Pannable full-screen view** for exploring large family trees
- **Visual connections** showing family relationships across generations

Click on any family member to view their detailed information, including birth/death dates, biographical notes, and family connections. The tree starts with Mayer Amschel Rothschild, the founder of the banking dynasty, and shows how his five sons established banking houses across Europe in Frankfurt, Vienna, London, Naples, and Paris.
