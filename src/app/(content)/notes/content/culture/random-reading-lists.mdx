<Box>I spend a awful lot of time being nosy. I like to see what other people are buying, reading, studying. How, and why it differs from myself. 
It is also interesting to try to find correlation between a type of people and the content consumption associated with them.</Box>

So without further ado here is a list of random reading lists I have *found on the internet. 

This list includes goodreads profiles, personal blog links, amazon wishlists, ect. in the rare cases that someone has typeset their entire reading list in plain text where extensive enough I 
am likely to have given it it's own page such as [Luke Smith's Library](/notes/libraries/luke-smith-library). Lastly you may notice some big names, you may not notice some small names, regardless these are 
being documented here as I find them, and in the order I find them.
