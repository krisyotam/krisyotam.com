# Luke Smith’s Personal Library

This is an archival snapshot of Luke Smith’s personal library. According to Luke, this is not a list of all the books he has read, liked, or endorsed. Rather, it reflects the current contents of his physical collection—some titles are used as resources, others are kept for reference, and a few exist purely for aesthetic or decorative purposes.

He originally compiled this list to aid in organizing his library and tracking his holdings. Books are arranged according to the [Library of Congress Classification](https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcco/), which provides a logical and systematic method for sorting materials by subject. As of the time of his writing, Luke noted that he owned over 1,000 books—many of which are not yet listed online.
