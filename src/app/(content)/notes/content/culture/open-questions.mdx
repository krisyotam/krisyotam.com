# Open Questions

This is a list of questions to which I find current answers unsatisfactory. 
This list is inspired by several other similar lists by the likes of 
[Gwern](https://gwern.net/question#sociology), [Patrick Collins](https://patrickcollison.com/questions), 
[Alex Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/research-ideas/), [Sam Enright](https://samenright.com/ideas/), and 
[Scott Alexander](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/quests-and-requests). It is important to note that just because 
an idea has one or several answers that does not mean that they are "satisfactory", and until a answer that is so is 
provided the question will remain listed here. Questions below are organized by field, and on occassion sub-field. Such as 
Mathematics > Algebraic Number Theory. Also note that I do not actively take requests on what goes here. However if shown a 
interesting question/problem I feel fits, it will likely end up here. 

# Process

Questions are added to the page > solutions are identified > I create a write up named "remarks on [solution]". > 
that entry is updated with the link to the remarks post and "(solved)" is added next to it. 

## Science & Technology

- What are the fundamental limits of computation?
- How do we achieve safe artificial general intelligence?
- What is the nature of consciousness?

## Society & Economics

- How do we design institutions that remain beneficial over long time horizons?
- What are the most effective ways to reduce global poverty?
- How do we balance individual freedom with collective welfare?

## Philosophy & Meaning

- What constitutes a life well-lived?
- How do we derive meaning in an apparently meaningless universe?
- What are our moral obligations to future generations?

*This list is continuously updated as I encounter new puzzles and resolve old ones.*
