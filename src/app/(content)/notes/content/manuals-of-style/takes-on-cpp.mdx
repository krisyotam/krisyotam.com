<Collapse title="Purpose of Guide">
For those wondering I intend on using C++ strictly for competitive programming. I am learning C, Python, and Bash to take care off a number 
of other issues such as my planned open source contributions, scripting, and data analysis. So while I may have a abundance of usecases that arise for the C++ language at a later date. 
The state of this guide is for practical C++ use in Competitive Programming.

<Collapse title="Where to find me">
I have not completely decided on how I will split my time or the practice of certain languages and on which platforms. However you can currently find me on the platforms 
below which over the next year (05/04/2025) should all see at least some use.

<Box>I have abstracted my [coding philosophy](/blog/2025/a-manifesto-for-holistic-computing) into a post that covers my philosophy for hardware, software, and coding as these tend to be language independant frameworks.</Box>

# C++ Style Guide

A comprehensive guide to writing clean and efficient C++ code. 

## Interactive Code Examples

Below is an example of a simple algorithm implemented in C++.


## Proper Formatting

The code above follows key C++ formatting guidelines:
- Consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Proper spacing around operators
- Clear function and variable names
- Appropriate comments for complex logic

```cpp
// Example function in C++
int add(int a, int b) {
return a + b;
}
```

## Interactive Family Tree Visualization

Below is an experimental integration of our new genealogy component. This family tree shows key members of the Rothschild banking dynasty, starting with the founder Mayer Amschel Rothschild. Click on individual family members to see more details or use the expand button to view the full tree.
