<Box>For a lot of things I do a very wide knowledge base is generally useful in multiple ways. 
Especially the type of knowledge known as Declarative Knowledge.</Box>

<Collapse title="What is Declarative Knowledge?"> the type of knowledge that involves facts and information you can consciously recall and 
state—"knowing that" something is true. It includes things like names, dates, definitions, and concepts, such as "The Earth orbits the Sun."</Collapse>

# On Anki 
As I am sure many of you know, Anki is a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you learn and retain infromation. I use it to help me remember 
specific facts, concepts, and information that I find useful. If you are interested in copying my decks, you can also find them on my [Anki Profile](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1234567890).
However I will list them all here for easy access. I would reccomend going through a breif tutorial on how to use Anki before you start using these decks. It can get very overwhelming, very quickly.
