# A Concise History of ThinkPads
<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">O</Dropcap>ld ThinkPads have been a staple in tech, particularly the Linux community at large for quite some time now. First launched 
by IBM in 1992 ThinkPads became a staple in the business community. They were a representation of reliability, innovation, and prestige. They kept pace througout the 90s as 
being predominantly used by businesses, and some rather affluent individuals. It seems during this era ThinkPads started to become a "Cult Brand" with a strong reputation in the 
business world as reliable laptops.
