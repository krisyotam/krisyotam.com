<Collapse title="Why Favs?">
People seem somewhat obsessed with peoples favorite things. Their favorite colour, food, movie, book, ect. In addition to this they love to put 
people on the spot and ask them to name their favorute thing(s). As if you could give a accurate answer with so little time to think about it. So in 
preperation of this I have created a list of my favorite things. In which I will defer to when asked about my favorite things.

# The Excluded Items 
Some items are excluded from this list. Not because I don't have a answer, but rather becuase I have put them in a more specific place. Among that list are. 
- **Anime/Manga**   
    - [Favorite Anime](/anime)  
    - [Favorite Manga](/manga)  
    - [Favorite Characters](/anime)  
    - [Favorite People](/anime)  
    - [Favorite Companies](/anime)  
- **Film**   
    - [Favorite Movies](/film)  
    - [Favorite TV Shows](/film)  
    - [Favorite Actors](/film)  
    - [Favorite Directors](/film)  

# On Ranking 
Some of these items I participate in, some I am just an observer of. 
Regardless treat each section as it's own with the ranking descending from most to least favorite. 
Some sections where ordering like this would ge quite tedious for me I have opted for a more natural 
ordering. Such as in the follow poetry section where authors are listed and poems indented under them 
for ease of expansion.
