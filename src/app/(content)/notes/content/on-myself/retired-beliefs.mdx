# Retired Beliefs

Ideas I once held strongly but have since abandoned. Each represents a small death of certainty and a rebirth of understanding.

## About Success & Achievement

**Former belief**: Success is mostly about hard work and determination.  
**What changed my mind**: Observing how much luck, timing, and privilege affect outcomes. Hard work is necessary but not sufficient.

**Former belief**: The best person always gets the job.  
**What changed my mind**: Seeing how much hiring depends on cultural fit, unconscious bias, and who you know rather than pure competence.

**Former belief**: If you're good at something, you should monetize it.  
**What changed my mind**: Learning that turning every skill into a revenue stream can kill the joy that made you good at it in the first place.

## About Learning & Education

**Former belief**: More information leads to better decisions.  
**What changed my mind**: Realizing that information overload often leads to analysis paralysis and that wisdom is more about filtering than accumulating.

**Former belief**: Formal education is the best way to learn anything important.  
**What changed my mind**: Discovering that the most valuable skills I have were learned through experimentation, failure, and direct experience.

**Former belief**: Smart people are right more often than others.  
**What changed my mind**: Watching intelligent people make systematic errors due to overconfidence and blind spots.

## About Technology & Progress

**Former belief**: Technology always makes life better.  
**What changed my mind**: Seeing how social media, smartphones, and other "improvements" can decrease rather than increase well-being.

**Former belief**: Efficiency is always good.  
**What changed my mind**: Learning that some inefficiencies serve important purposes—like building relationships, providing redundancy, or creating space for serendipity.

**Former belief**: Automation will free humans to do more creative work.  
**What changed my mind**: Observing that automation often just creates new forms of busy work and surveillance rather than liberation.

## About Human Nature & Relationships

**Former belief**: People are basically rational.  
**What changed my mind**: Studying behavioral psychology and observing my own irrational decisions despite knowing better.

**Former belief**: Good communication can solve most relationship problems.  
**What changed my mind**: Discovering that some conflicts stem from fundamental incompatibilities rather than misunderstandings.

**Former belief**: Everyone wants to improve themselves.  
**What changed my mind**: Realizing that many people prefer the familiar discomfort of their current situation to the uncertain discomfort of change.

## About Work & Career

**Former belief**: Following your passion is the key to career satisfaction.  
**What changed my mind**: Seeing that passion often follows mastery rather than preceding it, and that "do what you love" is privileged advice.

**Former belief**: Working harder will always lead to better outcomes.  
**What changed my mind**: Learning about the diminishing returns of effort and the importance of working on the right things rather than just working more.

**Former belief**: Competition brings out the best in people.  
**What changed my mind**: Observing how zero-sum thinking can destroy collaboration and create perverse incentives.

## About Money & Economics

**Former belief**: Rich people earned their wealth through superior skill or effort.  
**What changed my mind**: Understanding how compound advantages, inheritance, and systemic factors play larger roles than individual merit.

**Former belief**: The market is efficient and rational.  
**What changed my mind**: Witnessing bubbles, crashes, and the role of psychology in economic decisions.

**Former belief**: More money will solve most problems.  
**What changed my mind**: Seeing how additional wealth often creates new problems and that many of life's challenges are not financial in nature.

## About Personal Development

**Former belief**: You can become anything you set your mind to.  
**What changed my mind**: Accepting that genetics, circumstances, and timing place real constraints on possibilities, even with maximum effort.

**Former belief**: Consistency is the most important virtue.  
**What changed my mind**: Learning that rigid consistency can prevent adaptation and that sometimes changing course is wisdom, not weakness.

**Former belief**: Self-improvement is always good.  
**What changed my mind**: Realizing that constant optimization can become a form of self-rejection and that acceptance is sometimes more valuable than change.

*Each retired belief made room for a more nuanced understanding. The goal isn't to stop having strong beliefs, but to hold them lightly enough that they can evolve.*
