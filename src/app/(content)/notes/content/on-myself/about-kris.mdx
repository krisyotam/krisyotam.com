> When I have occasionally set myself to consider the different distractions of men, the pains and perils to which they expose themselves at court or in war, whence arise so many quarrels, passions, bold and often bad ventures, etc., I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact: that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber. A commission in the army would not be bought so dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the town; and men only seek conversation and entering games, because they cannot remain with pleasure at home.

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap>f you are looking for a more concise, or even perhaps aesthetically pleasing presentation of this information although more limited. I beseige you to use the
grid view mode by toggling the button at the bottom left of the page. In this page I will try to give the rather uninteresting answers to Who are you?, What have you done?, Where are you online?, and other
typical questions a proper about page should answer. If you were looking for something more up to date about specific goals for the month I have a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)[^nowpage]
which is located [here](/now). I am currently <Age format="age" />. I am currently a student studying for a mathematics B.S. with a Pure Mathematics certificate. If you are interested
in more maths related content [see here](https://krisyotam.net). I am also a practicing software engineer learning C, C++, and Python. My interests are in Systems Programming, Embedded Systems, and Computer Architecture.[^sysinterests]
I also have a <Define>penchant</Define> for web design. Web development has also recently become a hobby of mine. I am not a bleeding edge person, and tend to be more of a never adopter.[^neveradopter] I like stable things that fit my
usecases and are easy to use. So Next.js will be my ongoing webframework of choice for the forseeable future. I tend to dabble quite a bit in applications of unique ideas like [script](/scripts/404-suggester.js) using the levenshtein distance[^levenshtein]
to calculate the distance a user's mistyped url is from the various urls of my site, and suggest the assumed proper urls ordered by closest match first. I enjoy [reinventing the wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel), it's a frequent pastime of mine.
I owe much to the mindset of [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) on the basis of
<Quote author="Richard Feynman">What I cannot create, I do not understand.</Quote>
You could consider me both a [Classicist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism) and a [Innovator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation). I am a classicist in the sense that I believe in the importance of the old masters, and taking as much as possible from them. Furthermore I do disagree with the modern notion that "newer" is inherently better.[^chesterton]
Rather I am of the belief that
<Quote author="Kris Yotam">Rules are meant to be broken once they are understood.</Quote>
Man was created to be a master of multidues, not to have a multitude of masters.
<Quote author="Walt Whitman">Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. I am large, I have multitudes.</Quote>
To that end I am interested in a [number of things](/about#areas-of-interest). One of my major interests happens to be [Pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy). Specifically that of the
[Classical Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_education#:~:text=Classical%20education%20refers%20to%20a,and%20cultural%20life%20were%20laid).[^classicaledu] I advocate for ad fontes learning, and [living](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_return).
I also write the [progymnasmata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progymnasmata) myself, excercises can be [found here](/progymnasmata).[^progym] I maintain a philosophical approach to life that emphasizes ethical consideration and thoughtful reflection. My personal worldview naturally influences my perspective on various topics. In response to this inherent bias, I have implemented a "certainty" rating system
for all pages, prose, verse, categories, tags, etc.[^certainty] This is a rating from certain-impossible, and I base this off of mainstream scientific views. So something that is rated relatively low may be a foundational belief of mine, while something that I do not personally support may be highly rated. This covers most of the [media bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias). I am not an emotional person so
most essays I write will tend to be highly generous to both sides. Even to topics I consider problematic, I am likely to explore from multiple points of view. Such is the reflective nature of 'writing', and one that does not necessarily betray the same approach in person.

# Work
I'd love to have a career in academia, open source software, or something more of the likes of [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/).[^80k] I'm particularly interested in areas that have a high ability
for ai assistance, and automation. As well as those areas that can be greatly accelerated with unique ideas, and approaches. I am not interested in mundane, repetivie tasks, and those
that require much manual work with little ability to automate. For those of you who share similar interests, and would like to follow my journey finding a career like this I will be tracking
everything related to that in this [post]().

## Writing/Research/Learning/Maintaining krisyotam.com
Honestly these things do take up a significiant amount of time and energy. Thankfully however with the constant innovation of the AI Race I have been able to increase outputs, while decreasing the amount of time
required to get them by several orders of magnitude.[^aiproductivity] It's truly remarkable. I am able to focus on slow living reading the classics over, and over again while extracting all of the insights out of fad books, manuals, and
other trendy books/media instantly with things like [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), and a well curated [Prompt Collection](). I can use cursor in tandem with Obsidian to help autoamte cleaning, and linking my notes together.[^obsidian] In addition
I can have prompts that help find unique insights or ideas using my Obsidian database. As far as learning goes, with the heap of knowledge about **memory** I am able to abuse several techniques like spaced repetition[^srs] for
learning massive amounts of declarative knowledge which makes everything else easier. Ideas such as Cognitive Load Theory[^clt], Interleaved Practice, Deliberate Practice[^deliberate], and the Feynman Technique are all things I use to accelerate
my learning. It's also a massive help that without spending much time on manual research myself I can have several deep research reports generated for me, and in tandem with LLMs unify them into Ultralearning curriculum for immersive learning.[^ultralearning]
All in all I am able to do a lot more with a lot less time, and energy. So even though I hope to one day be able to monetize likely with patreon. I do not see any of the aforementioned as a bottleneck to a meaninful career.

## Current Work
My current work involves a lot of freelance writing, affiliate marketing, and scarce AI training data curation.[^datacuration] I also work a 9-5 which I will not specify here for obvious reasons.

## Why Academia?
I believe that education is the most **fundmental** and **foundational** of all human endeavors. The bedrock of the society so to say. With this comes the responsbility as a nation, state, community, and Individual to
ensure that the education system is not only effective, but also equitable, accessible, and inclusive. I have a strong preference for classical education using ad fontes techniques, and resources as I feel it produces
the most well-rounded, capable, articulate, and critical thinkers.[^trivium] The people we need to **fix** the world, and **solve** the problems of the future. I also believe it produces the people with the moral values to
know when they shouldn't act on their knowledge, as opposed to those who might misuse it for personal gain, power, or lust of knowledge.
> Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
>  — Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park[^jurassic]

## Why 80,000 Hours?
> You'll spend about 80,000 hours working your career; 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, for 40 years. So how to spend that time is one of the most important decisions you'll ever make.
> — Benjamin Todd, 80,000 Hours[^todd]

    Each dot illustrates one of the 80,000 hours in your career. If you could make your career just 1% more impactful, or 1% more enjoyable, it would be worth spending up to 1% of your career figuring out how to do so. That would be five months of full-time work — or 800 hours. Fortunately, this guide only takes about four.

As a Effective Altruist[^ea], I believe the most effective thing anyone one person can do is to find a career that is both fulfilling, and enables them to
make as much positive change as possible. That also means considering the long-term impact of their work, and how it aligns with their values and goals.
I am particularly interested in careers that have a high direct potential for positive impact, such as those that are fairly involved with one of the [World's Most Pressing Problems](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/).[^problems]
More specifically I am interested in careers that are involved with the following areas: AI Alignment[^alignment], Existential Risk Reduction[^xrisk], and Education Reform.

# Online Presence
I am a lot of places online. Although in the future this list will be shrinking rather than growing, I will try to provide
as comprehensive a list of the platforms I actively engage with. As well as if I think I will be doing so in the years to
come.[^digitalminimalism]

### Social (Mastadon/X/Reddit/Quora)
Out of the many socials I have the 4 that are something other than a placeholder for my username are these. They are the only accounts I am logged into
more often than not. I am fairly active viewing posts on a dozen or more subreddits daily, and same for some Quora questions. My contributions will
probably be sparse on Quora, and on reddit most likely in the subreddits r/OpenAI, r/csMajors, r/learnmath, r/mathbooks, r/matheducation,
r/puremathematics, r/math, r/compsci, r/physics, askphysics, r/theoreticalphysics, r/marinebiology, r/psychology, and r/philosophy.

### Mathematics (AoPS/MathOverflow/MathStackExchange)
I am currently active on these 3 platforms for mathematics finding resources, worked out solutions, ect.[^aops]
I expect to participate in "MathOverflow", and "MathStackExchange" a lot more in the coming years.

### Poetry (AllPoetry/Poets.org)
I spent a lot of time reading both classic, and contemporary poetry. A lot of this I do in books such as the **Oxford Book Of English Verse**.[^oxfordverse]
However when it comes to online resources for reading I utilize [poets.org](https://poets.org/), and for writing in pubic, and consumption of amateur verse I spend a
fair amount of time browsing [AllPoetry](https://allpoetry.com/).

### Effective Altruism / AI Alignment (Alignment Forum/EA Forum/LessWrong)
With Effective Altruism, and AI Alignment quickly becoming some of the largest, and most important areas in my life. I will be spending a considerable amount of time on these forums now, and in the coming years.[^lesswrong] My involvement with writing content on them as opposed to reading user created content should have a positive correlation with my knowledge on the topics.

### Competitive Programming (Codeforces, LeetCode, CodeChef, CodeWars, AtCoder)

### CTFs

# Profile


# Personality


# Philosophy

<Dropcap>H</Dropcap>ere I will try to stick to a overhead view of my personal philosophy. I will go into some depth realting to topics such as Minimalism, Asceticism,
Rationalism, Slow Living, Intentional Living, Classical Education, Quietism, Stoicism, and Ad Fontes Living. I realize those are fairly blanket terms, and there is really
nothing to be done about such in regards to giving a accurate preview of what is to come. What has been excluded from this to be covered in other posts are my [philosophy on programming](),
[philosophy of physical sciences]() detailing my approach to (mathematics, logic, and computer science), [Forms of Thinking]() catalouging my approach to learning, [philosophy on systems]() covering my phliosophy on software and hardware systems,
and [toward a literary life]() which covers my approach to literature.

### Minimalism

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
>
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry[^exupery]

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap> thought I would cover this first as Minimalism is the most foundational of the philosophies, and most integral to my mental health, and way of being. By way of my obsessive learning style
based on [Scott Young's Ultralearning](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/). Unecessary complexity can cause a lot of problems in my life via [Decision Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue).[^decisionfatigue] It's because of this that I tailor my
life as much as possible around [proactive planning](/blog/2025/on-practive-planning) of future needs. [Overstimulation]() happens to be another dangerous thing following maximalism. It is detrimental to anyone
looking to lead a dedicated, fulfilled, and focused life. By way of decreasing attention span.[^attention] Devices, unwanted meetings, and relationships you don't even care about can cause [Productive Procrastination](/blog/2025/on-productive-procrastination).
I am truly not the biggest fan of real life ads.[^ads]

> People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time, they are the most wasteful of the one thing in which is it right to be stingy.
> — Seneca[^seneca]

As Seneca says people are far to profuse when it comes to the time they are willing to give menial things. At the risk of sounding caustic, I am very <Define>fastidious</Define> with the things I allow to take up my time. My goal is to create a contant flux of
positive food through the senses (Auditory, Olfactory, Gustatory, Tactile, Visual).[^sensory] People put obscene thought into diet plans but little think about the diet of the other senses. Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, or Touching the wrong the thing
can take hours of focus away from one's day at best, and months at worst. So it is best to be overly cautious when it comes to the type of person you are and the things you consume both actively, and unconctiously.

### Asceticism

<Dropcap>M</Dropcap>y approach to asceticism is driven by a commitment to wisdom and understanding.[^asceticism]
The most important form of this being wisdom and understanding for the purpose of practical application in daily life. As far as I am aware this is a somewhat
controversial take that people must keep the law? Or rather a convuluted one on what the law is, as most christians don't traditionally seem to think that sin is ok. This is not something
I plan on covering here but in another post at a later date. I do however feel it is worth mentioning that my belief in living a legalistic life can be derived from <Bible>Ecc 12:13-14</Bible>.[^ecclesiastes]
My natural goals can be most elegantly summed up as <Quote author="Ada Lovelace">"I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at, etc., etc."</Quote>
As such it is in my interest to avoid the numerous forms of distraction and meaningless pursuits that can detract from genuine understanding and purposeful living.


### Rationalism

### Slow Living

### Intentional Living

### Classical Education


### Quietism


### Stoicism


### Ad Fontes


# Diet

<Dropcap>T</Dropcap>he one eats is the way one thinks. A sentiment I picked up from the late Nicola Tesla who stressed the importance of high-quality food, preferring fresh vegetables,
fruits, legumes, milk, and egg whites.[^tesla] He avoided egg yolks and acid producing foods, believing they could impair health and mental function. He directly linked his diet as the sustaining
force behind his <Define>veracious</Define> work ethic. Even being adamant about the avoidance of stimulants such as coffee, tea, and tobacco considering them harmful to both physical and mental
well-being. I share his conviction of some of the harsher stimulants like (tobacc), and in others like coffee I am currently more torn on.[^caffeine] I am completely opposed to the open disdain of tea however
and do not plan on living a life without it. I am in a phase of my life where as a young adult I lack much of the stability that many have in there later years, and tend to throw myself entirely at
work. Writing, Developing, Researching, Studying, ect. from sometimes 10-12 hours at a time with 1-2 meals a day, and a lot of tea to sustain me. This has done no benefits to me as I have suffered from
Sleep Apnea, Microsleep Blackouts, and Sleep Paralysis.[^sleep] Admittely most of my unconventional polyphasic sleep of around 3-4 hours per day comes from these Microsleep Blackouts, and the Sleep Paralysis from
my mind being ready to get back to work while my body lies wholly opposed. I am currently into research about correcting my diet so I will share some of what is planned now.

The goal is to rely upon a more Alkaline Diet.[^alkaline] The theory is that acidic foods cause [acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), and mucus in the body leaving a breading ground for harmful bacteria and disease. In short that this
can all be avoided with some form of Naturalist diet relying on mostly fruit and vegitables. At the current time I have no plans of converting in full to such a diet. The claims are interesting, and from
anecodotal evidence I can even vouch for the short term results. However only raw uncooked fruits, and vegitables is out of the realm of plausiblity for me currently. I am leaning toward something more simialar
to what is seen on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uPxj32epDQ). Something of this sort allows me to continue to polish my culinary ability, learn about various cultures of food, and to eat a healthy
diet routinely without lack of variety. I do not plan on using this as dogma either however. I intend on enjoying the occasional [French Silk Pie](https://gbskitchen.com/french-silk-pie-an-american-classic-since-1951/).
This leneancy should not do to much damage as I am rather tame on the sweets in the first place, and have alkaline alternative to practically any normal meal I'd ever eat. The only thing here is meat. I'd like to
have a proper discussion on this topic in the future. At the moment I will continue to eat chicken, beef, and turkey.[^meat]

# Exercise
[^exercise]

# Morals
My moral framework is anchored in compassion, equality, and a deep concern for the preservation of what I consider sacred.[^moralfoundations] I score **76% in Care**,
reflecting a strong inclination toward protecting others from harm and responding to suffering with empathy and action. With **98% in Equality**, I
have an almost uncompromising commitment to fairness, reciprocity, and the dismantling of unjust hierarchies. I also score **92% in Purity**, though
this is less about traditional morality and more about preserving psychological clarity, resisting moral degradation, and aspiring to personal and
cultural integrity. My **61% in Loyalty** reveals that I value meaningful bonds and principled allegiance—loyalty not to groups by default, but to
people, ideas, and causes that earn my trust. At **32% in Authority**, I am skeptical of power structures and deferential hierarchies, favoring earned
respect over institutional obedience. Lastly, my **27% in Proportionality** suggests a moral leaning away from strict deserts-based justice; I tend to
prioritize compassion over calibration, and mercy over retribution.[^haidt] Altogether, these values orient me toward a vision of life that is cooperative
rather than competitive, redemptive rather than punitive, and always questioning of the forces that claim to rule us.


# Entertainment
As im sure you have figured out by now I am a bibliophile, cinephile, and audiophile.[^phile] I love to read, watch movies, and listen to music. I also enjoy playing video games, but not a lot of story mode games anymore. I also don't put as much time into gaming as I used to.
I just stick to the few games I am already familiar with, as there is little to no learning curve required for continued enjoyment. I am in support of piracy, and I do not pay for any of my media.[^piracy] I do not support the current state of the entertainment industry,
and I do not plan on supporting it in the future. However I do contradict that statement in a few ways to make my life drastically easier. Such as paying for [Tidal](https://tidal.com/) in order to have a high quality music streaming service, and last.fm for tracking everything
I listen to.[^tidal] I also pay for the [Criterion Channel](https://www.criterionchannel.com/) to have access to a large library of classic films, and documentaries.[^criterion] Criterion Channel is the only place I watch films for the most part. On the occassion I want to watch something new, obscure, or a
non classic favorite I will use either [HuraWatch](https://hurawatchtv.tv/), or [Soap2Day](https://soap2day.to/). For anime I use [AniCli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli), and for manga I use [MangaFire](https://mangafire.to/). For those of you wondering where I track my media, I will
list all the methods below.
<Collapse title="Media Tracking">
- [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) - **Cinema**
- [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/) - **Books**
- [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) - **Music**
- [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) - **Anime/Manga/Manwha/Mahua**

# Uses This

Others often ask—both in real life and across various online communities—what my setup, tech stack, or ["Uses This"](https://usesthis.com/) is. I never mind sharing; I'm genuinely interested in what tools people choose and what trade-offs matter to them. However, I have a peculiar psychological makeup. The way I framed disappointment as a child likely plays a monumental role in this. Simple things such as having to compromise between my wanted color of a [Nintendo 3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS) or iPhone are most likely reasons for my highly idiosyncratic style of setup. This makes this post more complex than most. I can best be described as someone maximalist in scope, yet minimalist in execution—I only worry about optimizing after significant maximizing has been done. After all, "more is more."

> Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes.)
>
> Walt Whitman, Song of Myself, 51 (1819 - 1892)

In that vein, I run a hybrid setup of a custom-built PC and an M4 Mac Mini. Between the two devices I maintain all three major operating systems, as my PC dual boots Windows 11 and Arch Linux. The drives used for Arch are properly encrypted to reduce the attack surface caused by Windows having access to them. My use of Windows is reduced to the little gaming I do socially or for reviews, while macOS—although not as involved as Arch—stays an integral part of the workflow, giving me access to a Mac-specific suite of tools I will cover in the forthcoming sections.



## Software

I run [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with a tiling window manager ([dwm](https://github.com/krisyotam/dwm)) and rely heavily on CLI and TUI tools.

Most of my work for [krisyotam.com](https://krisyotam.com) and [notes.krisyotam.com](https://notes.krisyotam.com) is split between [Emacs Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) for editing Markdown and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for development. The majority of collaborative dev work happens in [Zed](https://zed.dev/) and [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/). Zed earned its place mainly for its speed and collaborative features—the ability to chat and write notes together. Warp handles my multi-tabbed [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) workflow, allowing me to keep my [st](https://github.com/krisyotam/st) simple rather than patching in tabbed mode. Most of my prose and verse is currently written in [Typora](https://typora.io/), while for light novels, novellas, and future novels I use [novelWriter](https://novelwriter.io/). Apologies for the redundancy that follows—some items from this brief overview are re-mentioned in the section-by-section breakdown below.

#### Core System

[Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) runs with [dwm](https://github.com/krisyotam/dwm), a tiling window manager created by [Suckless](https://suckless.org/). My opinionated views align nicely with the [Suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/), so you'll notice a trend of core utilities from the [Suckless rocks](https://suckless.org/rocks/) section. The terminal is [st](https://github.com/krisyotam/st), paired with [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) for tabbed management of [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and [Codex](https://openai.com/index/openai-codex/)—plus one for aesthetic value and UI. [Fish](https://fishshell.com/) serves as my primary shell with vi-mode and the [Starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) handles terminal multiplexing. For solo development there's [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (running [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)); for larger collaborative projects, [Zed](https://zed.dev/) efficiently leverages CPU and GPU cores with seamless collaborative features. [Emacs Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) handles .org files for [notes.krisyotam.com](https://notes.krisyotam.com) as well as .md and .mdx for [krisyotam.com](https://krisyotam.com).

[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org/) is the audio server, [Dunst](https://dunst-project.org/) the notification daemon, and [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) the dynamic colorscheme generator. [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) serves as the system monitor. [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/) handles passwords, [calcurse](https://calcurse.org/) the calendar, and [arbtt](https://arbtt.nomeata.de/#how) time tracking. [scron](https://github.com/krisyotam/scron) replaces cron, and [quark](https://github.com/krisyotam/quark) remains in use as a minimal web server. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) provides fuzzy finding, [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) a smarter cd, [direnv](https://direnv.net/) per-directory environment variables, and [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) manages my [dotfiles](https://github.com/krisyotam/lazykris). The screen locks with [slock](https://tools.suckless.org/slock/).

#### Communication

To keep email CLI-centric, [NeoMutt](https://neomutt.org/) pairs with [Proton Mail Bridge](https://proton.me/mail/bridge) for local decryption and reading. [catgirl](https://git.causal.agency/catgirl/) handles IRC, [abook](https://abook.sourceforge.io/) the address book. I recently switched from [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/) to [sfeed](https://codemadness.org/sfeed.html) for more holistic control over feeds. On iPhone, [Signal](https://signal.org/) handles secure communication; on Pixel, a custom Signal fork called [Molly](https://molly.im/). I'm planning a massive decrease in usage of Discord this year—the trade-off of privacy simply isn't worth the gain of menial conversations with strangers.

#### Browsers

For a brief period I entertained Brave as a replacement for my multi-browser setup due to the built-in Tor tabs. The scant simplicity that came with the downgrade offered little value. Earlier this year I reverted to [qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/) (hardened with custom config and vim bindings), [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/) (hardened with [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) and [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl)), and [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/) for anonymity. [Surf](https://github.com/krisyotam/surf) serves as a minimal reading browser.

Over time I've used many browsers across macOS, Windows, and Linux—modern, archaic, and terminal-based—including Chrome, Safari, [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.net/), [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/), [Arc](https://arc.net/), [Thorium](https://thorium.rocks/), [Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/), [Mullvad Browser](https://mullvad.net/browser), [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/), and [Pale Moon](https://www.palemoon.org/). I'm currently considering trying the FSF's homegrown browser, [IceCat](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/).

[Kagi](https://kagi.com/) serves as my search engine for research—the best experience I've had since manually putting [Gwern's tips](https://gwern.net/search) into practice.

#### Media

[nsxiv](https://github.com/nsxiv/nsxiv) handles images, [mpv](https://mpv.io/) (with vim keybindings) handles video, [mpd](https://www.musicpd.org/) + [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp) handle music, and [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) handles PDFs and EPUBs.

[Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) is configured for Org Mode work.



## Hardware

I outsourced the most recent build to [Micro Center](https://www.microcenter.com/)—both due to the stress I carried at the time and the lack of resilience I knew would follow from breaking expensive parts with their ever-creeping prices. I opted for a powerful prosumer build to avoid top-of-the-line prices, something that would allow experimentation with local LLMs, voice and image models, ML training, and the massive datasets that come with them.

The workstation was built with the most gorgeous case I've ever seen—the [Corsair 5000X](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-cases/cc-9011212-ww/icue-5000x-rgb-tempered-glass-mid-tower-atx-pc-smart-case-white-cc-9011212-ww), carrying over from my previous build. Components include a [Lian Li SP750](https://lian-li.com/product/sp750/) Gold Rated ATX PSU, [Intel Core Ultra 7 265K](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/240966/intel-core-ultra-7-processor-265k-30m-cache-up-to-5-50-ghz/specifications.html), [ASUS Z890 ROG Strix](https://rog.asus.com/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-z890-e-gaming-wifi/) motherboard, 64GB (4x16) of [Crucial DDR5 6400MHz](https://www.crucial.com/memory/ddr5/cp2k16g6400mt5), 6x [Corsair RS120 ARGB](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/case-fans/co-9050153-ww/rs120-rgb-120mm-pwm-fan-white-co-9050153-ww) fans, [Corsair Nautilus 360 ARGB](https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/cpu-coolers/cw-9060076-ww/nautilus-360-argb-white-all-in-one-liquid-cpu-cooler-cw-9060076-ww) AIO cooler, 2x [Crucial P310 1TB Gen4 NVMe SSDs](https://www.crucial.com/ssd/p310/ct1000p310ssd2), and 2x [Seagate Barracuda 2TB 3.5" HDDs](https://www.seagate.com/products/hard-drives/barracuda-hard-drive/). For GPUs, I opted for 2x [AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-7900xtx).



## LLMs

Both cloud and local AI models are in regular use—local models handle anything requiring privacy. Current cloud subscriptions include [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) ($20), [Claude Max 5x](https://claude.ai/) ($100), and [Google AI Pro](https://ai.google/) ($20). Local models running via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) include deepseek-r1:14b, qwen2.5:14b, llama3.1:8b, and mistral:7b. [Faster-Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) handles speech-to-text, and [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/) sees occasional use for image generation.

[^pascal]: Pascal's *Pensées* (French for "Thoughts") is a collection of fragments on theology and philosophy, published posthumously in 1670. This particular passage (§139 in the Lafuma numbering) is one of Pascal's most famous observations on the human condition. See the full text at [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18269).

[^nowpage]: The "now page" concept was popularized by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff) as a way to share what you're focused on at this point in your life. It's meant to be more dynamic than an about page but less ephemeral than social media.

[^sysinterests]: Systems programming involves writing software that provides services to other software, such as operating systems, compilers, and network protocols. My interest in this area stems from the desire to understand computers at a fundamental level—something increasingly rare in an age of abstractions.

[^neveradopter]: The technology adoption lifecycle categorizes users from innovators to laggards. I deliberately position myself as a "never adopter" for most consumer technology, preferring to wait until tools have proven their long-term value. See [Crossing the Chasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm) for the canonical framework.

[^levenshtein]: The [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to change one string into another. It's named after Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein who introduced it in 1965.

[^chesterton]: This aligns with [Chesterton's fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence)—the principle that reforms should not be made until the reasoning behind the existing state of affairs is understood.

[^classicaledu]: Classical education follows the Trivium (grammar, logic, rhetoric) and Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy). Dorothy Sayers' essay ["The Lost Tools of Learning"](https://www.gbt.org/text/sayers.html) (1947) is the foundational modern text on this approach.

[^progym]: The progymnasmata are a series of fourteen rhetorical exercises developed in ancient Greece and Rome. They were the standard curriculum for teaching rhetoric for over 1,500 years. See [The Forest of Rhetoric](http://rhetoric.byu.edu/) for a comprehensive guide.

[^certainty]: This rating system is inspired by [Gwern's own certainty tags](https://gwern.net/about#confidence-tags) and the broader [epistemic status](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/epistemic-status) practice in the rationalist community.

[^lovelace]: Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) is widely regarded as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is considered the first algorithm intended for machine processing.

[^clt]: [Cognitive Load Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load) (Sweller, 1988) describes how working memory limitations affect learning. Understanding it is essential for designing effective study materials and curricula.

[^deliberate]: Anders Ericsson's research on [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice) shows that expertise comes from focused, structured practice with immediate feedback—not mere repetition.

[^ultralearning]: Scott Young's [*Ultralearning*](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ultralearning/) (2019) describes an aggressive, self-directed learning strategy. His MIT Challenge—completing MIT's 4-year CS curriculum in 12 months—demonstrated the approach.

[^datacuration]: AI training data curation is becoming increasingly valuable as models require higher-quality, specialized datasets. See [Scale AI](https://scale.com/) and [Appen](https://appen.com/) for context on this industry.

[^trivium]: The Trivium consists of Grammar (the mechanics of language), Logic (the mechanics of thought), and Rhetoric (the use of language to instruct and persuade). These three arts were considered foundational to all other learning.

[^jurassic]: From the 1993 film directed by Steven Spielberg, adapted from Michael Crichton's 1990 novel. Ian Malcolm's character represents the voice of scientific caution against hubris.

Key organizations include [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/), [Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/), and the [Centre for Effective Altruism](https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/).

[^problems]: 80,000 Hours maintains a [list of problem profiles](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/) ranking global issues by scale, neglectedness, and tractability. Currently, AI safety and biosecurity rank among the highest priorities.

[^alignment]: AI alignment is the challenge of ensuring that artificial intelligence systems act in accordance with human values and intentions. Key resources include [MIRI](https://intelligence.org/), the [AI Alignment Forum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/), and Anthropic's [research](https://www.anthropic.com/research).

[^xrisk]: [Existential risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk) refers to risks that could result in human extinction or permanent civilizational collapse. The field was largely established by Nick Bostrom's work at the [Future of Humanity Institute](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/).

[^digitalminimalism]: Cal Newport's [*Digital Minimalism*](https://calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) (2019) provides a philosophy for technology use focused on intentionality rather than abstinence.

[^aops]: [Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) (AoPS) was founded by Richard Rusczyk and offers resources for students interested in competition mathematics. Their textbooks are considered among the best for developing mathematical maturity.

[^oxfordverse]: [*The Oxford Book of English Verse*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oxford_Book_of_English_Verse) is an anthology first published in 1900 by Arthur Quiller-Couch. Multiple editions have been published since, making it one of the most influential poetry anthologies in English.

[^lesswrong]: [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) is a community blog focused on rationality, cognitive science, and AI alignment. It was founded by Eliezer Yudkowsky in 2009 and has been influential in the rationalist and AI safety communities.

[^exupery]: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (1900-1944) was a French writer and aviator, best known for *The Little Prince*. This quote comes from his memoir *Wind, Sand and Stars* (*Terre des hommes*, 1939).

[^decisionfatigue]: Roy Baumeister's research on [ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion) suggests that self-control and decision-making draw from a limited pool of mental resources. Though the replication crisis has challenged some findings, the practical advice to reduce unnecessary decisions remains sound.

[^attention]: Johann Hari's [*Stolen Focus*](https://stolenfocusbook.com/) (2022) documents how modern technology systematically degrades our ability to concentrate. Gloria Mark's research at UC Irvine found that after a distraction, it takes an average of 23 minutes to return to the original task.

[^ads]: Tim Wu's [*The Attention Merchants*](https://www.timwu.org/AttentionMerchants.html) (2016) traces the history of advertising and its colonization of our mental space from the penny press to social media.

[^seneca]: From *On the Shortness of Life* (*De Brevitate Vitae*), written around 49 CE. The complete text is available at [Wikisource](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/On_the_shortness_of_life).

[^sensory]: The concept of a "sensory diet" is primarily used in occupational therapy for sensory processing disorders, but the broader idea of managing sensory input for cognitive performance has merit. See [The Extended Mind](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/311230/the-extended-mind-by-annie-murphy-paul/) by Annie Murphy Paul.

[^asceticism]: [Asceticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism) has traditions across virtually all major religions and philosophical schools. My approach draws primarily from Stoic and Christian sources rather than Eastern traditions.

[^ecclesiastes]: Ecclesiastes 12:13-14: "Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the duty of all mankind. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil."

[^tesla]: Nikola Tesla's dietary habits are documented in various biographies, including W. Bernard Carlson's [*Tesla: Inventor of the Electrical Age*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691057767/tesla) (2013). Tesla was known for sleeping only 2 hours a night and maintaining strict dietary regimens.

[^caffeine]: The research on caffeine is genuinely mixed. Matthew Walker's [*Why We Sleep*](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Why-We-Sleep/Matthew-Walker/9781501144325) presents a strong case against regular caffeine use, while other researchers argue its cognitive benefits outweigh costs. See Gwern's [caffeine analysis](https://gwern.net/nootropics/caffeine).

[^sleep]: Sleep disorders like sleep apnea affect an estimated 22 million Americans. The [Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/) provides evidence-based information on sleep health.

[^alkaline]: The alkaline diet lacks strong scientific support—the body tightly regulates blood pH regardless of diet. However, the diet's emphasis on fruits and vegetables provides benefits through other mechanisms. See [this systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3195546/).

[^meat]: The health and ethical implications of meat consumption remain contested. For a balanced overview, see [Our World in Data's analysis](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production).

[^exercise]: Section to be expanded with details on my exercise routine, which has historically been inconsistent but is currently under development.

[^moralfoundations]: These scores are from Jonathan Haidt's [Moral Foundations Questionnaire](https://moralfoundations.org/questionnaires/). His book [*The Righteous Mind*](https://righteousmind.com/) explains the theory behind these foundations.

[^haidt]: Jonathan Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory identifies six (originally five) psychological foundations that underlie moral judgments across cultures: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression.

[^phile]: "-phile" from Greek *philos* (loving). These terms describe someone with an intense appreciation for books (bibliophile), cinema (cinephile), and high-fidelity sound reproduction (audiophile).

[^piracy]: The ethics and economics of digital piracy are complex. For a nuanced view, see [this collection of essays](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2012/03/on-piracy.html). My position is pragmatic rather than principled—I support creators directly when practical.

[^tidal]: [Tidal](https://tidal.com/) offers lossless audio streaming (FLAC/MQA), which matters for critical listening. Whether most people can distinguish lossless from high-quality lossy in blind tests is [debatable](https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2015/06/09/412271433/is-lossless-audio-really-worth-it).
