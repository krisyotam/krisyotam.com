I started watching Twitch streams in 2018, and pretty much only watched Pokimane. I wasn't big on exploring and was a casual viewer while doing other things. 
Some other honorable mentions would be some Geometry Dash streamers such as KnobbleBoy, Trusta, AeonAir, and Npesta. Later on when I started fortnite in chapter 2 season 5, I 
started watching more streamers specifically for the game. This list included Clix, Bugha, EpikWhale, Pxlarized, Reet, Quesy, and a ton of others. Over the years I have also been 
in and out of various other streamers such as xQc, Mizkif, Cinna, qtCinderella, and more. So you can treat this as just about as exhaustive an answer as I will ever be able to give 
to the question. What streamers do/did you watch? I will try to keep this list updated if I remember any more streamers I watched, or come across past information via alt twitch accounts, screenshots, ect.
