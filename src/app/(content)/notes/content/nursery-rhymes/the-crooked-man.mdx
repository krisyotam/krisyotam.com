# Original Version
<Box>
There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile,  
He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile;  
He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse,  
And they all lived together in a little crooked house.  
</Box>

# Valak's Version (Conjuring II)
<Box>
There was a crooked man... and he walked a crooked mile  
The crooked man stepped forth and... rang the crooked bell  
And thus his crooked soul... spiraled into a crooked hell  
Murdered his crooked family... and laughed a crooked laugh.  
</Box>
