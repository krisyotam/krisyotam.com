<Box>
Jack and Jill went up the hill  
To fetch a pail of water;  
Jack fell down and broke his crown,  
And Jill came tumbling after.  

Then up Jack got and home did trot  
As fast as he could caper,  
And went to bed to mend his head  
With vinegar and brown paper.  

Then Jill came in and she did grin  
To see his paper plaster;  
Her mother whipped her across her knee  
For causing Jack’s disaster.
