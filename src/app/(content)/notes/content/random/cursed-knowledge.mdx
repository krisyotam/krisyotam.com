# Cursed Knowledge

Things I wish I could unknow. Information that, once learned, changes how you see the world—usually for the worse. Consider this your content warning.

## About Food & Health

- **Processed food engineering**: Learning how food scientists design products to be maximally addictive, using specific combinations of salt, sugar, and fat that trigger dopamine responses
- **Factory farming realities**: The actual conditions in which most meat, dairy, and eggs are produced
- **Microplastics ubiquity**: They're in our water, food, air, and bloodstream. There's no escape, and we don't know the long-term effects
- **Sugar industry manipulation**: How Big Sugar suppressed research about sugar's health effects for decades, similar to tobacco companies

## About Technology & Privacy

- **Data broker profiles**: The incredibly detailed profiles companies build about you from seemingly innocuous data points
- **Attention economy mechanics**: How social media platforms are designed to create addiction and maximize engagement at the cost of mental health
- **Smartphone tracking**: Your phone tracks your location even when you think it's off, and this data is sold to hundreds of companies
- **AI training datasets**: Many AI systems are trained on data scraped without consent, including private conversations and copyrighted material

## About Economics & Society

- **Wealth concentration mathematics**: How compound interest and capital gains ensure that wealth inequality grows exponentially over time
- **Planned obsolescence**: How products are intentionally designed to fail after a certain period to drive repeat purchases
- **Marketing psychology**: The sophisticated psychological manipulation techniques used in advertising and retail design
- **Healthcare profit incentives**: How treatment is often more profitable than prevention or cures

## About Human Psychology

- **Cognitive bias catalog**: Once you know about confirmation bias, anchoring, and availability heuristic, you start seeing how wrong your brain is about everything
- **Social proof manipulation**: How easy it is to manufacture consensus and make people believe false things through fake social signals
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Recognizing how much of life is spent continuing bad decisions just because you've already invested in them
- **Dunning-Kruger effect**: The more incompetent someone is, the more confident they tend to be, and this explains a lot about public discourse

## About Media & Information

- **News cycle manipulation**: How stories are timed and framed to distract from other news or serve particular interests
- **Astroturfing prevalence**: How much of what appears to be grassroots opinion is actually manufactured by PR firms
- **Search engine bias**: How Google and other search engines shape what information you can find and in what order
- **Historical revisionism**: How much of what you learned in school was simplified, biased, or outright false

## About Environmental Reality

- **Climate feedback loops**: The self-reinforcing cycles that make climate change accelerate beyond what linear models predict
- **Ecosystem collapse timelines**: How quickly biodiversity loss is occurring and what it means for food systems
- **Ocean acidification**: The "other CO₂ problem" that's killing marine ecosystems and getting less attention than global warming
- **Topsoil depletion**: We're losing the soil that feeds us faster than it can be replenished

## About Personal Relationships

- **Attachment theory implications**: How your early childhood experiences continue to shape your relationships in predictable ways
- **Relationship statistics**: The actual success rates of marriages, the prevalence of infidelity, and what predicts relationship failure
- **Social network effects**: How your friends' friends' friends can influence your behavior and decisions without you knowing
- **Empathy limits**: Humans can only meaningfully care about about 150 people, which explains a lot about society's problems

## About Existential Realities

- **Heat death of the universe**: Everything will eventually end in maximum entropy and cold darkness
- **Fermi paradox implications**: The various explanations for why we haven't found alien life, and what they suggest about our future
- **Mortality salience**: How awareness of death influences almost every decision you make, usually unconsciously
- **Simulation hypothesis**: The mathematical argument that we're more likely to be in a simulation than base reality

## About Work & Career

- **Peter Principle universality**: Most people rise to their level of incompetence and stay there
- **Bullshit jobs prevalence**: How many careers involve work that adds no real value to the world
- **Automation displacement**: Which jobs will be eliminated by AI and how quickly it's happening
- **Meritocracy myth**: How much success depends on luck, privilege, and circumstances rather than merit

*Knowledge is power, but some knowledge is a burden. Once you know these things, you can't unknow them. They change how you see everything else.*
