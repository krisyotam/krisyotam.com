## Key Insights

Carter G. Woodson published this groundbreaking work in 1933, addressing how the American education system of his time failed to properly educate African Americans. His insights on the systemic issues in education remain relevant today, as he critiqued:

- How education was designed to maintain social hierarchies
- The importance of culturally responsive teaching
- How historical narratives shape identity formation
- Why critical thinking must be central to true education
