Despite being labled as a character analysis, posts of the form "Character Analysis of [Character Name]" are more like personally crafted wiki pages 
followed by source anthologies of quotes, scenes, character moments, interviews, and other media related to the character. More of a Obsessive Anthology 
with Analytical Commentary in Chronological Order.

Lisa Rowe portrayed by Angelina Jolie is possibly the most enigmatic character in Girl, Interrupted. A misguided teenage socipath that 
feels like it's her job to play the villan.
