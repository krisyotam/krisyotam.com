# ==============================================================================

This entry comes from the *Preserving Worlds* project, a documentary series chronicling virtual worlds that have survived long past their commercial viability. The featured world here is **WorldsChat**, a pioneering 3D social space launched in 1994 — and remarkably, still online today.  
WorldsChat allowed users to create avatars, build spaces, and chat in a 3D environment. What began as a utopian digital hangout gradually evolved into a strange, vibrant labyrinth of outsider art. It’s one of the earliest examples of user-driven worldbuilding in persistent online environments.  
A notable part of this archival snapshot is the 2015 interview with **GradualDIME**, an independent archivist documenting user-generated content in WorldsChat. He guided the team through notable locations and recounted the brief intersection between WorldsChat and 4chan’s /x/ board.  
This interview predates the official *Preserving Worlds* pilot and was initially meant for another documentary, *[Sarasota Half in Dream](https://sarasotamovie.com/)*, before becoming a standalone short.
