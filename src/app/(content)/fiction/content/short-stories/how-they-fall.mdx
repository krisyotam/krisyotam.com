# How They Fall 

<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">C</Dropcap>lick-clack... it was best known that the miller kids were quite placid, and of humble origin. If it were under any other circumstances this story would not see the light of day, 
for fear of my life. It is in response to this fear; this cowardly debilitating fear that I must tell of the Miller kids. So it my breaks my heart that they would be the subject of the press today. It was 1875 in Warwickshire England, 
william the son of lori & adam morris begged his parents for one of the newly released gadgets. A typewriter they called it. The Morrises did well for themselves, they weren't in debt, owned a home, produced there own food, and easily 
met their daily needs. However since their kids were born they gave up everything to savings in hopes of giving their children a better life. 

<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">W</Dropcap>illiam dashed into the kitchen heart pounding; with a flush face. "MAMMA!," William Said, "I must have a type writer". Adam frowned "You have a pencil, and enough paper for a print shop. What need have you for this trinket?".
"Well darling your father is right, what can this machine do that a pencil can't?". Will sighed "Ive saved up my money for 3 years, i only need [] mamma please." Adam sat his glass down, "Lower your voice boy. It's to early for all of that hollering." "How about this." Lori said, 
"I can give you []". Will dishearteningly pouted, "It won't be enough" he said. Lori's heart broke as Will ran out the door. "Hes worked so hard all these years." she mumbled. "He'll get over it by dinner said adam. Trinkets come and go, work is permenant. 
If you don't work you don't eat, and that's that." William tore through the front gate. His mind moving a million miles an hour. "What if they're all gone?", "What if I don't make it in time?" he thought to himself. Will paced back and forth for quite some time before 
he decided to walk to town. "Where is he going?" said Lori as she watched with trepidation from the window. Adam shook his head in dissapointment. "AURORA!" Lori screamed. "Follow your brother and make sure he doesn't get into any trouble". "He seemed quite upset storming out of here like that, 
but that is no reason for him to treat me and his father like that. I expect a full apology upon his return.". Aurora sulkingly replyed "Do I have to mom?". "Yes and take the trash on your way out" Lori replied. As aurora peered outside will had already started up the road. Almost 100m out by the 
time she began to follow him. His mind continued to ruminate as he approached the village. Even without enough money to purchase the type writer his mind forced him to believe he had a chance. As will walked through the town gate he noticed everyone had gathered together in a small area. Everyone was 
packed so tightly together he couldn't see what was going on. As he got closer he heard a rather unfamiliar voice. "Step right up and get your Invite! The winning submission will be the recipient of a brand new typewriter, and a chance at a invite to the famed academy Chateu De Noya." Will's face lit 
up as he pushed through the crowd to grab himself a sheet. Once he got his hands on a sheet he began to turn around when the old man spoke to him. "Do you plan on participating boy?" said the man. Will looked up at the man, who looked to be in his 
late 70s. A rather unseemly looking man. "yes" wil said reluctantly. "Is.. is that okay?" he said as the choked words came out. "Yes, I look forward to it said the man.". By the time will had turned around to head back home Aurora had made her way through the gate. 
"WILL" she called out. Hearing his sister's voice will jolted in her direction to relay the news.

"Aurora, Aurora, Look. Look at what I have." said will frantically before he could even catch his breath. "Slow down will. What is it?" said aurora. "The Old Man, he's having a competition. Whoever wins gets a typewriter." Aurora curious turned her eyes in the direction will came from, but she saw no old man. 
The only proof she had that was ever there. Was the sheet in Will's hand. "Let's go home" Aurora said. They began to walk home while will kept his head buried in the paper. Reading, and re-reading the rules of the competition. After around 20min they arrived back at home. Will burst through the door exctatic. 
"Mamma, Papa! Look at what I've got". Adam, and Lori sat at the table where they had been previously. Will confused as to why they did not look happy turned to Aurora. Aurora perplexed she had forgot they were waiting for an apology for Will's earlier display. "Mom. Dad. I couldn't catch up with him, but as soon as 
I got to town and grabbed him we headed back. It slipped my mind what he had did by that point." She said. Still Adam had not moved, his face sat still. Lori turned to face the two children. "You are seriously going to return here after 3 hours, and act as if nothing has happened?" said Lori. Auroras heart slowed almost to 
a still. She had glanced at will who to was fairly confused. "But we were only going for a mere 30min? 40 maybe but 3hours, there is simply no way!" said Aurora. Will shook his head furiously in agreement. "You two are dismissed. Me and your father will discuss your punishment." "But mom!" Lori said in a dissapointed manner. 
"There is no way we were gone for 3 hours, that just isn't possible." Will made his way upstairs as he knew there was no convincing them anyways. He rushed through the hall way to his room, and shut the door. Jumped on his bed and pulled the sheet out of his pocked.
