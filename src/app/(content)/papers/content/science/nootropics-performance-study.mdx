# Idea
Track your own (or volunteers’) sleep and nootropic use with a wearable device and daily log. Compare subjective energy, mood, 
and focus with objective results from small online or local cognitive tasks. Analyze if perception matches actual performance 
and how nootropics interact with sleep quality.
