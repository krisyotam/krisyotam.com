# Idea
Create a dataset of moral dilemmas (like trolley problems, real-world ethical cases, etc.) and survey how different people 
respond to them. Then use that dataset to evaluate whether existing LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) mimic human responses, diverge 
in systematic ways, or exhibit biases. Explore implications for alignment.
