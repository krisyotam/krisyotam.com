stress, anxiety, and external pressure the core of most problems could be subsided given equally intensive, and sustained thought. It has been my observation that most people carry with them the tools to solve there problems, and more importantly the indirect skills as well. Much like Pascal it is my thought that a man with an ability to sit quietly in a room alone is as a calm river washing against the rocks. Is is through much consideration on a given topic. Much thinking, presuming, and further  thinking that subdues a problem. It is even in my model that solutions both psychological and concrete can be gathered with sparse time spent developing a reasonable conjecture. 

A logical example can be identified with a simple situation such as this. I have long had a problem with productivity. It is far to say that this has costs me a great deal of time. Say we calculate my time at school/work, sleep, and my free time over the last 8 years roughly since I started high school. We can assume 8 hours of sleep of night (reasonably frequently less), and 8 hours of work/school. With any remaining time being free. We will take a arbitrary start date maybe 2018.08.21 which sounds fairly accurate. As well as the end date being today 2026.02.13. 

<Collapse title="THE MATHHH...">

Let each day be indexed by $d = 1,2,\dots,N$.

Assume the daily allocation of time is

$$
S_d = 8
$$

$$
W_d = 8
$$

$$
F_d = 24 - S_d - W_d = 8
$$

so that the daily time vector becomes

$$
(S_d, W_d, F_d) = (8,8,8).
$$

Let us now take the total time horizon beginning at 2018-08-21 and ending at 2026-02-13.
Counting inclusively,

$$
N = 2734.
$$

The total hours across the entire period are therefore

$$
H_{\text{total}} = 24N = 24 \cdot 2734 = 65616.
$$

Summing across days, total sleep becomes

$$
H_{\text{sleep}} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} S_d = 8N = 21872.
$$

Total work/school time becomes

$$
H_{\text{work/school}} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} W_d = 8N = 21872.
$$

Total free time becomes

$$
H_{\text{free}} = \sum_{d=1}^{N} F_d = 8N = 21872.
$$

Now suppose that 20% of free time was spent on spontaneous activity and the remaining 80% was structured work.

Spontaneous time:

$$
H_{\text{spontaneous}} = 0.20 \cdot H_{\text{free}} = 0.20 \cdot 21872 = 4374.4.
$$

Structured work time:

$$
H_{\text{structured}} = 0.80 \cdot H_{\text{free}} = 17497.6.
$$

If structured time yielded only 33% productive output, then effective productive hours become

$$
H_{\text{productive}} = 0.33 \cdot H_{\text{structured}}.
$$

Substituting,

$$
H_{\text{productive}} = 0.33 \cdot 17497.6 = 5774.208.
$$

Thus total effective productivity from free time across the entire horizon is

$$
H_{\text{productive}} \approx 5774.21.
$$

The remaining free-time hours represent either spontaneous activity or inefficient output:

$$
H_{\text{inefficient}} = H_{\text{free}} - H_{\text{productive}} = 21872 - 5774.208 = 16097.792.
$$

Let us now consider a second scenario in which productivity increases by 1% per day, bounded at a realistic ceiling of 90% efficiency.

Let initial productivity rate be

$$
p_0 = 0.33,
$$

daily growth factor

$$
g = 1.01,
$$

and upper bound

$$
p_{\max} = 0.90.
$$

Then productivity on day $d$ becomes

$$
p_d = \min(p_0 \cdot g^{d-1},\; p_{\max}).
$$

We reach the ceiling when $p_0 \cdot g^{d^*-1} = p_{\max}$, giving

$$
d^* - 1 = \frac{\ln(p_{\max}/p_0)}{\ln(g)} = \frac{\ln(0.90/0.33)}{\ln(1.01)} = \frac{\ln(2.7273)}{0.00995} \approx 100.85.
$$

So on day $d^* = 102$ we first reach 90% efficiency. That is roughly **3.4 months**.

The total productive hours now split into two phases. Daily structured time is

$$
H_{\text{s}} = 0.80 \cdot 8 = 6.4.
$$

**Phase 1** (growth, days 1 to 101):

$$
H_1 = H_{\text{s}} \cdot p_0 \cdot \frac{g^{101} - 1}{g - 1} = 6.4 \cdot 0.33 \cdot \frac{1.01^{101} - 1}{0.01} \approx 365.9.
$$

**Phase 2** (at ceiling, days 102 to 2734, spanning 2633 days):

$$
H_2 = H_{\text{s}} \cdot p_{\max} \cdot 2633 = 6.4 \cdot 0.90 \cdot 2633 \approx 15166.1.
$$

Total bounded productive hours:

$$
H_{\text{bounded}} = H_1 + H_2 \approx 365.9 + 15166.1 = 15532.0.
$$

Compare this to the flat 33% scenario:

$$
H_{\text{productive}} \approx 5774.2.
$$

The ratio is

$$
\frac{H_{\text{bounded}}}{H_{\text{productive}}} = \frac{15532.0}{5774.2} \approx 2.69.
$$

A 1% daily improvement, capped at a reasonable 90%, yields **2.69 times** the productive output over the same period. And the growth phase occupies only 102 of 2734 days — less than 4% of the total horizon. The remaining 96% is spent operating at near-peak efficiency.

With this model we can see that peak productivity in most things can be reached fairly fast with only 1% increases. Our ballpark now becomes, how to get better by 1% everyday? The answer to continuous improvement comes in the form of a flywheel.

The first thing to do is to try to create a effective model of problems, and inefficiencies. What is going wrong? Why is going wrong? Most importantly what solutions do I have at my disposal to deal with it. For ex. you are
