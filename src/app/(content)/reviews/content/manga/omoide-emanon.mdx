# Premise 
[**Memories of Emanon**]() is a series by [Kenji Tsuruta](), and [Shinji Kajio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinji_Kajio). It is 
based on Kajio's 1983 short story of the same name. The story is set in the winter during 1967 where a young man meets a "17-year-old hippie chick"
named Emanon while aboard a ferry. Emanon is a dialgoue-driven manga with a minimalist narrative. It constantly probes at the
intricacies of memory and identity, suggesting that the human condition itself may be shaped by the accumulation of remembered experience. 

# Presentation
The artwork in this manga could only be described as a Fever Dream. It has photorealistic influence, and paths, surroundings, ect. 
were drawn with architectural precision. The characters are drawn with naturalistic proportions but less intricate detail than the enviroment, making 
her subtly "pop out" against the highly detailed world. 

# Narrative
The story centers around our unnamed co-protagonist and his building relationship with Emanon shortly after their startling meeting. 
They tell stories, discuss serious topics, and every topic imaginable. The story shows how a fleeting moment can be so wonderful, deep, and 
[] and yet simultaneously insignificant on the grand scale of time.  


# Form & Structure
Most chapters include some watercolor paintings of Emanon that attempt to portray the complex themes that are being discussed. 
The dialogue is quick, snappy, and easy to follow along with. Whilst even the most subtle of emotions are well-portrayed by Tsuruta 
photorealistic line work. 

# Context


# Takeaway 
My takeaway from this manga is that each and every fleeting moment of life has meaning. Even if only those few moments 
that we hold on to are the ones that shape our conscious being, it is the compendium of every moment, every memory, and feeling 
no matter how fleeting that is expressed in the beauty of humanity and its continuity.
