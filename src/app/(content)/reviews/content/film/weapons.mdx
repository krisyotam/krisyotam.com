At 2:17 AM, seventeen children from Mrs. Gandy’s third-grade class walked out of their homes and into the dark. Only one—Alex—was left 
behind. This mass vanishing is the unsettling heart of Weapons, the latest horror film from Zach Cregger, director of Barbarian. Set in 
the fictional town of Maybrook, Pennsylvania, the story is fractured into six perspectives that gradually assemble a chilling mosaic. 
We begin with Justine Gandy (Julia Garner), a teacher reeling from the loss of nearly her entire class and vilified by desperate parents. 
From there, the film passes through a grieving father (Josh Brolin), a volatile cop (Alden Ehrenreich), a strung-out addict (Austin Abrams), 
and a school principal under siege (Benedict Wong), before arriving at Alex, the lone survivor. Cregger’s structure is deliberately 
disorienting, pulling us deeper into the community’s grief and paranoia with each shift in perspective. Taking inspiration from a list of films
