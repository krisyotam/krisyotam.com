The following are the nginx files that are in development for the reconstruction of krisyotam.com with optimizations both for 
self hosting, and for vercel. 

The goal is to have a mirrored site in this format 
# krisyotam.com | production site hosted on vercel and optimized for max speed 
# krisyotam.net | privacy focused optimized for self-hosting 
# krisyotam.eth | 
# onion url     | for the darkweb no js 


# krisyotam.com.conf 
# memoriam.sh
# syncd.conf 
# twdne.conf 



# Cleanup 

There are several dozens of components in the components directory. 

trace.ts --> a typescript script that is designed to read the components directory and find components that are not 
being used in the app directory make sure you dont accidently flag a component that is a part of a component that is 
being used in the app directory. 

I want a massive .txt file in /cleanup named components.txt that lists each component and under it all the 
file paths it appears in so I diagnose more complex ones.
