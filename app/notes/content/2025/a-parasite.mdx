# Test Note

## Introduction

This is a test note to explore how Markdown rendering works.

### Key Points:

- **Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax.
- It is often used for formatting readme files, documentation, and blogs.
- Some common features include:
  - **Headers**: `#` for h1, `##` for h2, and so on.
  - **Bold Text**: `**Bold**` or `__Bold__`.
  - **Italic Text**: `*Italic*` or `_Italic_`.
  - **Lists**: `-` or `*` for unordered, and `1.` for ordered lists.

## Example Code

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
