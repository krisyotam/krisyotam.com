Suicidal feelings are not the same as giving up on life. Suicidal feelings often express a powerful and overwhelming need for a different life.  
Suicidal feelings can mean, in a desperate and unyielding way, a demand for something new. Listen to someone who is suicidal and you often hear a need for change so important, so indispensable, that they would rather die than go on living without the change.  
And when the person feels powerless to make that change happen, they become suicidal. Help comes when the person identifies the change they want and starts to believe it can actually happen. Whether it is overcoming an impossible family situation, making a career or study change, standing up to an oppressor, gaining relief from chronic physical pain, igniting creative inspiration, feeling less alone, or beginning to value their self worth, 
at the root of suicidal feelings is often powerlessness to change your life â€” not giving up on life itself.
