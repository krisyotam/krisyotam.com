# Zephyria: The Floating Archipelago

Zephyria consists of hundreds of islands suspended in the sky, drifting through an endless expanse of clouds. These floating landmasses range from tiny, uninhabited rocks to massive continents supporting sprawling cities, all held aloft by ancient technology and natural wind currents.

## Geography

The archipelago is organized into several major regions:

- **The High Havens**: Upper-level islands where the wealthy and powerful reside
- **The Middling Drifts**: Middle-altitude islands where most commerce and everyday life occurs
- **The Lower Reaches**: Islands closer to the cloud floor, often mining communities and industrial centers
- **The Uncharted Depths**: The mysterious cloud sea below, rumored to hide lost islands and strange creatures

## Society

Zephyrian society revolves around trade, exploration, and the mastery of wind. Sky pirates and merchant guilds hold significant influence, with political power often following economic success. The Council of Winds, comprised of representatives from major islands and influential factions, provides loose governance.

Social status is closely tied to one's vessel and crew, with the most respected captains commanding impressive airships and loyal followers.

## Notable Features

- **The Grand Skyport**: The largest trading hub where thousands of airships dock daily
- **Windstone Quarries**: Where the precious mineral that allows ships to float is mined
- **The Cartographers' Guild**: Mapmakers who chart the ever-changing positions of the islands
- **The Storm Barrier**: A massive weather control system protecting the central islands

## Current Conflicts

Zephyria faces numerous challenges:
- Increasing pirate raids on merchant vessels
- Dwindling windstone reserves threatening the archipelago's stability
- Political tension between the wealthy High Havens and the resource-producing Lower Reaches
- Rumors of islands falling from the sky after their windstone deposits were depleted

As resources grow scarcer and tensions rise, the freedom of the skies that Zephyrians cherish may be at risk, pushing the floating world toward conflict or innovation.
