\section{Default Code License}
Unless otherwise specified, all code examples, snippets, libraries, and programming projects explicitly marked as open source on krisyotam.com are released under the MIT License. Code not explicitly marked as open source is protected by copyright with all rights reserved.

\section{MIT License Terms}
For code released under the MIT License, the following terms apply:

\begin{quote}

\end{quote}

\section{Identifying Open Source Code}
Code released as open source under the MIT License will be clearly identified in one or more of the following ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item An explicit statement of "Released under the MIT License" near the code
  \item A LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file in the associated GitHub repository
  \item A comment block at the top of code files containing the MIT License information
  \item A note on the page containing the code indicating it is available under the MIT License
\end{itemize}

\section{Other Potential Licenses}
While the MIT License is our default, some projects or code examples may occasionally be released under different licenses. When this is the case, the specific license will be clearly indicated with the code. Potential alternative licenses might include:

\subsection{Apache License 2.0}
A permissive license similar to MIT, but with additional provisions related to patents. The full text of this license will be provided with any code released under these terms.

\subsection{GNU General Public License (GPL)}
A copyleft license that requires derivatives to be released under the same license. Any code released under GPL versions will be clearly marked as such.

\subsection{Proprietary License}
Some code may be published under a proprietary license with more restrictive terms. These restrictions will be explicitly stated wherever such code appears.
