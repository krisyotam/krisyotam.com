Site Policies for krisyotam.com: Legal Obligations and Best Practices
Terms of Service (User Agreement)
A Terms of Service (ToS) defines the rules users must follow on the site and outlines the rights and responsibilities of both users and the site owner
termsfeed.com
. For a personal publishing blog like krisyotam.com, the ToS should be comprehensive and “airtight” to protect against misuse and legal issues across major jurisdictions. Key elements and clauses to include are:
User Guidelines & Acceptable Use: Clearly prohibit spam, harassment, illegal content, or any behavior that violates standards of decency. Users posting comments or content must agree not to upload anything unlawful, offensive, or that infringes others’ rights. The ToS can reserve the right for the site to remove any user-submitted content at the owner’s discretion if it’s spammy or violates these rules. This ensures the site can maintain a respectful environment and terminate accounts or block users who abuse the platform (which also helps meet DMCA “repeat infringer” policy requirements
copyrightalliance.org
).
Privacy Policy Reference: Include a clause indicating that use of the site is also subject to the Privacy Policy
termsfeed.com
. This reassures users that their data is handled according to a stated policy and links them to details on data practices (important for legal compliance and user trust). For example, “By using this site, you also agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in our Privacy Policy.”
Age or Authorized Users (if Applicable): If any content is adult-oriented or not intended for children, the ToS should restrict use to appropriate audiences (e.g. “users must be 13+ or 18+”). Most personal blogs won’t need a strict age clause, but if krisyotam.com contains mature themes or paid services requiring contracts, it’s prudent to specify minimum age requirements
termsfeed.com
 for legal consent. This protects the site from issues under child protection laws (like COPPA in the U.S. for under-13 data collection) by not knowingly allowing children to use features.
Intellectual Property Ownership: Assert the site owner’s copyright over the original content (code, prose, verse, media) published on krisyotam.com. Under laws like the U.S. Copyright Act, the author automatically holds copyright in original works as soon as they are created
termsfeed.com
termsfeed.com
. The ToS should state that all original content on the site is owned by the site owner (or other indicated licensors) and is protected by copyright. Include a clause that grants the user a limited license to access and read the content for personal use, but forbids unauthorized reproduction or distribution beyond what the content’s specific license allows. This puts users on notice that the site’s writings, images, etc., are not in the public domain and cannot be freely copied without permission (except where a particular open license is explicitly provided).
User-Generated Content and License: If users can post comments or other content, clarify the rights around that content. Typically, the poster retains copyright to their own comments but must grant the site a license to display and store those comments. For instance, the ToS can say users grant krisyotam.com a non-exclusive, worldwide license to publish their comments. Also make clear that users are responsible for what they post and that it must not infringe others’ rights
termsfeed.com
. A disclaimer can state the site isn’t liable for user-generated content, and that it will remove content that violates law or policy. This aligns with safe-harbor principles by informing users that they must only post lawful, original material.
Copyright Infringement Policy: To be DMCA-compliant, include a clause explicitly addressing copyright infringement. State that copyright infringement is not tolerated on the site and provide a method for copyright owners to report infringing material
termsfeed.com
. For example, supply a designated contact email or a mailing address for DMCA notices (and later in a dedicated DMCA Policy page, list the required notice details). The ToS should note that upon receiving proper infringement notices, the site will remove or disable the content promptly
copyright.gov
. It should also state that repeat infringers’ accounts or posting privileges will be terminated
termsfeed.com
 – fulfilling the DMCA’s requirement to implement a repeat-infringer policy
copyrightalliance.org
. By embedding this in the ToS, the site bolsters its safe harbor protection under 17 U.S.C. §512. (See the DMCA Procedure section below for more specifics.)
Governing Law and Jurisdiction: Specify which country or state’s laws govern the agreement
termsfeed.com
. For a personal site run from, say, the U.S., one might choose the laws of the owner’s state (e.g., Illinois, USA) as the governing law. This clause is crucial given the site serves international users – it sets which jurisdiction’s law will apply in case of a dispute and where any legal action must be brought. For instance, “This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, USA, and any disputes will be resolved in Illinois courts.” This prevents uncertainty or having to litigate everywhere a user might reside. (Do note that consumer protection laws of a user’s country might still apply for certain issues, but a clear governing law clause is generally enforceable for contract terms
termsfeed.com
.)
Disclaimers (No Warranties, etc.): Include strong disclaimer language to limit liability. The site is providing content “as is” without warranties – meaning no guarantee of accuracy, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Especially since krisyotam.com includes not only factual content but also code, AI-generated text, and personal opinions, the ToS should make clear that use of the site is at the user’s own risk. For example, a common clause (often in all-caps for emphasis) might say the site disclaims any liability for errors or omissions in the content
termsfeed.com
. If code or advice is provided, clarify it’s for informational purposes and not professional advice (e.g. “no professional advice or consultancy relationship is formed”)
termsfeed.com
. Also note that while the site might mention third-party links or references via iframes, it doesn’t endorse or guarantee those external materials. Comprehensive disclaimers help protect against lawsuits by informing users that the content comes with no promises and that the site owner’s liability is limited.
Limitation of Liability: In addition to disclaimers, include a limitation of liability clause to cap potential damages. Typically, this states that the site and owner will not be liable for any indirect or consequential damages (like loss of data, profits, etc.) arising from use of the site. It can also cap direct damages to a small amount (often the amount the user paid, or a nominal sum if the site is free). Having a clear limitation of liability helps prevent costly claims for things beyond the owner’s control (e.g. if the site goes down, or content is inaccurate)
termsfeed.com
termsfeed.com
. Many sites use wording to the effect that the total liability of the site for any claim is limited to, say, $50 (or the smallest amount permitted by law). Note that some jurisdictions (like the EU, UK, Australia) have consumer laws that may not allow full exclusion of certain liabilities (e.g., personal injury or fraud). The ToS can include a phrase “except as required by law” to account for those non-waivable rights.
Paid Products or Services Terms: Since krisyotam.com offers paid newsletters and digital products, the ToS (or separate terms of sale) should address those transactions. Clearly indicate any fees, billing schedules, and refund/cancellation policies. For example, if a newsletter subscription is paid, specify the renewal period and how to cancel; if digital products (like e-books, courses, etc.) are sold, note whether all sales are final or if there’s a return policy. Make sure paid content is labeled as such on the site (which the user already practices by marking them clearly). Legally, this is important to meet consumer protection standards: users must know when they are entering a purchase agreement. Also, include a statement that the site owner can refuse or terminate sales/orders at their discretion (for instance, to prevent fraud). If using third-party payment processors (like Substack’s system or Stripe/PayPal), disclose that those services handle the financial data (see Privacy Policy) and that their terms might apply. While most personal sites are not heavily regulated e-commerce, it’s a best practice to include these terms to set expectations and comply with any applicable commercial laws (like EU directives on digital content rights or refunds).
termsfeed.com
Right to Modify or Terminate: Reserve the right for the site owner to modify any content or discontinue the service at any time. For example, the ToS can say the owner may delete posts, comments, or even shut down the site, at their discretion. This aligns with the user’s note that they retain the right to delete any content or data at their discretion. Also, allow the owner to update the Terms or other policies, with a notice to users (e.g., posting the updated date at the top of the ToS and noting that continued use implies acceptance). In multi-jurisdiction contexts, one might also clarify that if any portion of the Terms is found unlawful under local law, the rest remains in effect (a severability clause).
By covering the above points, the Terms of Service will provide a solid legal foundation. It protects intellectual property, limits liability, and sets conduct rules, which together reduce legal risk for the blog owner while giving users clarity on their rights. Always ensure the language is clear and easily accessible (avoid overly complex legalese) so that even with comprehensive coverage, the terms remain understandable to the average user
gdpr.eu
. This is important because an unenforceably obscure term won’t help; GDPR and many consumer laws require clarity in user agreements and notices.
Privacy Policy and Data Protection
Because krisyotam.com collects and processes some personal data (for analytics and newsletters), it must have a clear Privacy Policy addressing how user information is handled. In many jurisdictions, a privacy policy is a legal requirement for sites that gather personal data
cookiebot.com
. Laws like the EU’s GDPR, the UK Data Protection Act (UK-GDPR), Canada’s PIPEDA, California’s CCPA/CPRA, Australia’s Privacy Act, and others mandate transparency about personal data practices. Failing to comply can lead to hefty fines or penalties
cookiebot.com
. To be airtight and compliant across the U.S., EU, UK, Canada, Australia, etc., the Privacy Policy should include:
What Data is Collected: Provide a detailed list of the types of personal information the site collects
datagrail.io
. For krisyotam.com, this likely includes:
User-supplied data: such as email addresses and names (when users subscribe to the newsletter or leave comments). If users can create accounts or profiles, include those details as well.
Analytics data: e.g. IP addresses, browser type, pages visited, and other usage statistics collected via Seline Analytics (the site’s tracking tool). Even if Seline Analytics is a self-hosted or privacy-focused solution, it likely still gathers some personal data (like IP or a unique cookie ID) to track visits. Under GDPR, online identifiers like IPs or cookies are considered personal data if they can indirectly identify a user.
Cookies and similar technologies: Disclose if the site uses cookies, web beacons, or local storage – for instance, to remember user preferences or to track analytics. Since Next.js is in use, note if it sets any cookies (session cookies for login or CSRF tokens, etc.). Also mention cookies used by Substack for newsletter signup or by embedded iframes (if those external references set cookies).
Purpose of Data Collection: Explain why each type of data is collected and how it’s used
cookiebot.com
datagrail.io
. Be specific: e.g., email addresses are used to send the newsletter and important announcements; analytics data are used to understand traffic and improve the site’s content and performance; any comment information is used to display and moderate user comments. If the site uses AI for certain features (like AI-assisted comment filtering or generation), mention if any personal data is processed by those AI systems (for example, if an AI analyzes comment text or user behavior, that might count as processing personal data). Under GDPR, you should also state the legal basis for each processing purpose
dataprotection.ie
dataprotection.ie
: common bases would be consent (for sending email newsletters – user consents by signing up) and legitimate interests (for basic analytics or anti-spam measures, provided they’re not overridden by user rights). For each purpose, make it clear and legitimate (e.g., “We collect analytics data to understand how users engage with our blog and to detect technical issues, which is our legitimate interest in improving our service”).
Third-Party Services and Data Sharing: Disclose any third parties that receive user data, and why
datagrail.io
datagrail.io
. In this case:
Substack: If the newsletter is delivered via Substack, then subscribers’ email addresses (and possibly names) are processed by Substack. The policy should mention that “we use Substack to manage email subscriptions and distribution of our newsletter; thus, subscriber data is shared with Substack for that purpose.” It’s wise to link to Substack’s own Privacy Policy so users can see how Substack handles their info as a data processor.
Analytics Provider: If Seline Analytics is a proprietary or self-hosted tool, clarify whether data stays on your own server or if any third-party service is involved. (If Seline sends data to a cloud service or if it’s similar to an open-source analytics platform, mention that, though if it’s fully self-contained, you can say data is not shared with external analytics vendors). The key is transparency: who has access to the data besides the site owner? If none besides the site, state that clearly (users appreciate knowing their data isn’t being sold or shared indiscriminately).
Embedded Content: Since reference materials are hosted via iframes, note that iframes may pull content from external sites (e.g., a YouTube video, a PDF from another site, etc.), and those externals might collect data (like IP address or set cookies) when loaded. The policy can caution users that interacting with embedded third-party content is subject to those third-parties’ privacy policies.
Payment Processors: For any digital products or paid newsletters, if payments are handled through a third party (e.g., Stripe via Substack, PayPal, etc.), mention that financial information (credit card numbers, etc.) is not seen or stored by your site, but by the payment processor. Provide the name of the processor and perhaps reference their privacy safeguards.
Cookies and Tracking Consent: Especially important for compliance in the EU (GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive) and similar laws, describe the site’s use of cookies and how users can manage them. Identify which cookies are essential (e.g., those for site functionality or security) and which are non-essential (e.g., analytics or any advertising cookies). Since krisyotam.com uses analytics, those would be non-essential under EU rules, meaning EU users should ideally be given a choice to opt-in. State that the site uses a cookie banner or mechanism to obtain consent for analytics cookies, if applicable. For example: “We use a first-party analytics cookie to distinguish repeat visits; you will be asked for consent where required by law
gdprlocal.com
. You can also adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, though some functionality might be limited.” Emphasize transparency in cookie usage: users should know what data cookies collect and for what purpose
gdprlocal.com
 (e.g., “we set a cookie to know that you’ve visited before, which helps us count unique visitors
gdprlocal.com
”). For jurisdictions like California (CCPA), while explicit prior consent for cookies isn’t required as strictly as GDPR, you should still honor “Do Not Sell/Share My Data” preferences and avoid sharing cookie data with ad networks (if ever applicable).
Data Storage and Security: Explain how personal data is stored and protected. For instance, subscriber emails in the custom database are likely stored on a server – so mention measures like password protection, encryption, or restricted access. If data is stored in the cloud or on a third-party service, mention that and any relevant certifications (e.g., “our database is hosted by X company which maintains industry-standard security”). Also include how long you retain personal data
dataprotection.ie
: e.g., “We retain subscriber email addresses as long as you remain subscribed. If you unsubscribe, we will remove your email from our active list immediately and from all backups within X days.” For analytics data, perhaps you aggregate or anonymize it after some time or purge raw logs periodically (state the retention period if known, or say “we retain analytics logs for up to 12 months for trend analysis”). Demonstrating a data retention policy shows compliance with data minimization principles.
Users’ Rights: Inform users of their rights over their personal data, as required by laws like GDPR
dataprotection.ie
. Key rights include: right of access (to request a copy of their data you hold), rectification (to correct inaccurate data), erasure (“right to be forgotten” – they can request deletion of their personal data), data portability (to get their data in a common format), and objection (to object or opt-out of certain processing, such as direct marketing)
dataprotection.ie
. Also, if processing is based on consent, users have the right to withdraw consent at any time
dataprotection.ie
 (for example, they can unsubscribe from the newsletter to withdraw consent for emails). Even if the site is small, it should offer these options to EU users at least, and it’s a good practice globally. Practically, this means providing a contact method or interface for these requests. For instance: “If you wish to access, correct, or delete your personal data, please contact us at [contact email]. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe (within 30 days for most requests) in accordance with applicable law.” Additionally, GDPR and similar laws require that you inform users of their right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (like an EU Data Protection Authority or the UK ICO) if they believe their data rights are breached
dataprotection.ie
. Including that line shows thorough compliance.
No Selling of Personal Data: Make a clear statement on the site’s stance regarding personal data sales. Since this is a personal blog, presumably you do not sell or rent user data to third parties for marketing. Stating this outright not only builds trust but also covers CCPA requirements (under CCPA, if you did “sell” personal info as defined by the law, you’d need to offer a “Do Not Sell” opt-out link; if you don’t sell data, you can simply say so, which often exempts you from providing that link)
datagrail.io
datagrail.io
. For example: “We do not sell your personal information to advertisers or other third parties.” If you engage in any sharing that might be considered a “sale” (CCPA has a broad definition, including some cookie sharing), ensure you comply accordingly – but in this case it sounds like the site’s use of data is limited to functional purposes (analytics, newsletters) and not monetized via personal data, which is good.
Disclosure of Lawful Requests: It’s common to mention that the site may disclose personal data if required by law or valid legal process (e.g., responding to a court order or subpoena). Including this in the Privacy Policy is standard – e.g., “We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.”
International Data Transfers: Since the site likely has international visitors (EU, UK, etc.) but the server or services (Substack, etc.) may be based in the U.S., you need to address cross-border data transfers. Under GDPR, personal data of EU users can only be transferred out of Europe if certain conditions are met (adequacy decision or appropriate safeguards like Standard Contractual Clauses). Substack and any U.S.-hosted analytics inherently involve sending EU user data to the U.S. – the Privacy Policy should acknowledge this and note that you rely on acceptable legal mechanisms. For example: “If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or UK, be aware that your data may be processed in the United States where our servers and service providers are located. We utilize standard contractual clauses or other safeguards to ensure an adequate level of protection for international transfers, as required by GDPR.” This level of detail shows you’re mindful of GDPR’s cross-border data rules (important for an “airtight” policy).
Contact Information: Provide a way for users to reach out with privacy questions or requests
datagrail.io
. This could be an email address dedicated to privacy inquiries (e.g., privacy@krisyotam.com) or a contact form link. Under GDPR (Article 13), you must give the identity and contact details of the “data controller” (which is likely the site owner themselves)
dataprotection.ie
. If the site owner has an official business name or is just an individual, state that (e.g., “Data Controller: [Name], [Address or at least country], Contact: [Email]”). If applicable, also list a Data Protection Officer contact – though for a small personal site, a DPO is likely not mandatory. In any case, clear contact info signals accountability.
Additional Jurisdictional Notes: Since you want to cover US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia: you’ve largely done so by addressing GDPR/UK GDPR and CCPA. For completeness:
Canada (PIPEDA): Emphasize consent and reasonable purposes – which you have by explaining purposes and offering unsubscribe. PIPEDA also gives individuals rights similar to GDPR (access, correction), which you are covering.
Australia: The Privacy Act and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) apply generally to organizations over a certain size or that trade in personal info. Even if krisyotam.com might be a small operation possibly below that threshold, adopting those principles is wise. They require a clear privacy policy and give users rights to access/correct data. Notably, Australian law has an “APP 8 – cross-border disclosure” requirement, which is satisfied by explaining overseas data storage and ensuring similar protection (which your international transfer note addresses). Australia also requires consent for direct marketing and the option to opt-out, which your newsletter opt-out covers.
EU’s ePrivacy and PECR (UK): They mainly impact cookie usage – you’ve covered cookie consent/transparency already.
California/US state laws: Besides CCPA (California), other states (Virginia VCDPA, etc.) are coming online with similar “notice and choice” frameworks. By covering what data you collect, letting people opt-out of marketing, and offering deletion, you’re largely aligning with those too. You might include a section like “If you are a California resident, you have the right to request a notice of what categories of personal information we have collected and the right to request deletion of your personal info. We will not discriminate against you for exercising these rights.” (This mirrors CCPA’s requirements). Even if not strictly required due to the size of the site, including it shows best practice.
Finally, ensure the Privacy Policy is easy to find (e.g., linked in the site footer) and written in clear language (GDPR mandates it be in “concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form”
gdpr.eu
). The content we outlined provides transparency that builds user trust — users appreciate knowing what happens with their data
cookiebot.com
. Regularly update the policy as the site’s data practices or laws change, and include an effective date at the top so users know when it was last revised
datagrail.io
.
Copyright & Content Licensing Policy
Krisyotam.com should have a well-defined policy on content ownership and licensing, given it hosts both original content and AI-generated content, plus some open-source code and media. This section (which might be part of the Terms or a separate “Content License” page) will clarify what visitors can or cannot do with the site’s content, and under what conditions. Key considerations include:
Original Creative Works – Assertion of Copyright: All original works on the site (texts such as blog posts, essays, poems, as well as original photographs, videos, artwork, and code snippets written by the site owner) are protected by copyright law automatically from the moment of creation
termsfeed.com
. The site should explicitly claim copyright on these materials. For example, a statement can be included: “Except where otherwise noted, all content on this site is © [Year] Kris Yotam (or [Author Name]). All rights reserved.” This makes it clear that the default rule is no reproduction without permission. Under the U.S. Copyright Act (Title 17) and international conventions, the owner has the exclusive rights to reproduce, adapt, and distribute their works. The term of protection is generally the life of the author plus 70 years in the U.S., EU, and similar in other jurisdictions. By asserting copyright in site terms, the owner signals they will defend their intellectual property – unauthorized use is infringement and can lead to legal action
termsfeed.com
. Including this in the policy puts readers on notice not to copy text or images wholesale. It also gives the owner grounds (contractual and legal) to demand takedown of plagiarized content elsewhere or to seek remedies if needed.
AI-Generated Content – Ownership and Permissible Reuse: AI-generated content introduces a nuanced area of law. Current legal consensus (especially in the U.S.) is that purely AI-created works without human authorship are not copyrightable by the user or owner of the AI
perkinscoie.com
. U.S. courts have affirmed that “human authorship is the bedrock of copyright,” so if a piece of text or art is produced entirely by an AI with no creative input from a human, it may not qualify for protection
perkinscoie.com
perkinscoie.com
. Other jurisdictions are grappling with this: for instance, the UK has a provision in its Copyright, Designs and Patents Act that assigns authorship of “computer-generated works” to the person who made the arrangements for the creation, granting a 50-year copyright term
authorsalliance.org
authorsalliance.org
. However, it’s arguable how that applies to modern AI outputs and this is under review. Given this uncertainty, krisyotam.com’s policy should transparently address AI content ownership. Proposed approach: The site owner wishes to assert rights where defensible, so the policy can state: “Content generated with the assistance of AI (including writings by the fine-tuned model Kelex or others) is curated and published by the site owner, who asserts whatever copyright protection may exist in such content.” Essentially, the owner can claim a compilation or editing authorship role (if they fact-checked or creatively edited the AI output, that human contribution could support a claim to copyright in the final work
jonesday.com
). Even if full copyright is uncertain, the policy can treat AI-generated prose/verse as content the site controls. The owner can then license its reuse under certain conditions (since even if not strictly copyrighted, they can impose contractual terms for reuse). The question indicates the owner is happy to allow reuse of AI-generated text as long as citation is provided to krisyotam.com. This is essentially a very permissive license for those AI portions – akin to a Creative Commons Attribution license. For clarity, the policy could label such content or sections and say: “You may reuse AI-generated articles or poems from this site for any purpose provided you credit the source (KrisYotam.com) and, if possible, link back to the original.” This ensures that while the content is open for reuse, the site gets attribution credit. (Notably, a CC BY license explicitly allows any redistribution or remixing as long as attribution is given
creativecommons.org
, which matches the owner’s intent. The site could even explicitly release AI texts under CC BY 4.0 to formalize it.) Including a requirement for citation, even if copyright might not strictly apply, gives the owner a form of moral claim and discourages unattributed copying. It’s a best practice to clearly mark which content this reuse policy covers – for example, one might tag or footnote AI-generated posts with “Licensed for reuse with attribution.” This avoids confusion between AI content and fully original human-authored content.
Open-Source Code Licensing: The site contains original code, and the owner intends to open-source code snippets or projects with a permissive license. A permissive open-source license (such as MIT or Apache 2.0) allows others to use, modify, and distribute the code freely, with very minimal restrictions
en.wikipedia.org
en.wikipedia.org
. The MIT License, for example, basically says anyone can do anything with the code as long as they include the original copyright notice and license text in any redistribution
en.wikipedia.org
. The policy should specify which license applies to code that the owner chooses to release. For instance: “Original code examples posted on the site are released under the MIT License unless otherwise stated. This means you are free to use, copy, and adapt the code for any purpose, provided you preserve the license notice
en.wikipedia.org
.” By doing so, the owner makes clear which parts of the content are free software and encourages sharing and innovation, while also protecting themselves (the MIT license disclaims warranty and liability
en.wikipedia.org
, which is important since people might rely on code). Any code not explicitly labeled as open-source can be assumed under regular copyright (all rights reserved), so it’s wise for the policy to clarify that only specific code with a license notice is open-sourced. This avoids someone mistakenly thinking all site content is free to copy. In summary, highlight the license type (MIT) for open source code and possibly provide a link to the full license terms for users’ reference.
Media (Photos/Videos) Usage: The owner’s intention is to allow photos and videos from the site to be used by others if proper credit is given, whereas original artwork requires permission. The policy should distinguish these categories of media:
For photographs and video content that the owner has created (or has rights to): state that non-commercial reuse with attribution is permitted. If the owner is comfortable with commercial use as well, it can even be fully open (with just credit requirement). This effectively is a license grant to the public. For example: “Images and videos on this site may be reused in other works as long as you cite KrisYotam.com as the source and attribute the creator. No further permission is required for such reuse.” This is similar to a Creative Commons Attribution license or Attribution-NonCommercial if they want to restrict commercial use. If the intent is to allow even commercial uses with credit, CC BY would be the model (which “allows others to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material, even commercially, as long as attribution is given”
creativecommons.org
). If the owner prefers non-commercial reuse only, CC BY-NC style terms could apply (allow reuse with credit for noncommercial purposes
creativecommons.org
). The prompt suggests media can be used without consent if cited, implying even commercial is okay as long as credit – so likely a very open stance (like CC BY).
For original art/illustrations (e.g., custom drawings, graphic designs, or perhaps AI-generated art that the owner considers more sensitive): state that these are not freely reusable. Use wording like, “Artwork and illustrations (as identified on the site) are all rights reserved – you must obtain explicit permission from the owner to use these in any way.” This sets a stricter rule for art, reflecting the owner’s wish. The rationale can be that art might have higher creative value or might be something the owner plans to license or sell prints of, etc., so it’s understandable they require permission. It also covers any third-party art that might appear (though presumably the site mostly has owner-created content).
It’s good to have this spelled out so users don’t assume everything is open. The policy can include examples or explicitly list which works fall under which category, or at least clearly label in context (like a note under each image if it’s reusable or not). The Creative Commons/open licensing norms are useful references here – many personal sites say “text content is CC BY-NC, photos CC BY, artworks all rights reserved,” or some combination. Aligning with those norms makes it easier for users to understand what they can do.
Attribution Requirements: For content that is allowed to be reused (AI text, code, photos/videos under certain license), specify how to give attribution. A best practice is to require an acknowledgment like “Credit: [Title of Post], krisyotam.com” with a hyperlink if used online. The policy might even provide a sample attribution line. Creative Commons guidelines on attribution recommend including the title, author, source, and license
wiki.creativecommons.org
. Here, something simple like the site name (and author’s name if desired) suffices. The policy should also mention that if changes were made to the material by the reuser, they should note that (this is part of CC best practices
wiki.creativecommons.org
, to avoid confusion that the original author made those changes). Ensuring proper credit not only is courteous but also helps drive traffic or recognition back to the site, which is likely why the owner encourages citation.
Third-Party Materials and Fair Use: Clarify that any third-party content referenced on the site (for example, if the blog posts quote lyrics, or embed academic papers via iframe, or show screenshots) are owned by their respective creators and used on krisyotam.com under principles like fair use, fair dealing, or with permission. Phrases like “All trademarks or copyrighted material referenced are the property of their respective owners” can be included. Also, commit that if any external content owners object to their material being shown, the site will comply with removal requests (as the user intends, within 5–10 business days or so). This is essentially a courtesy/DMCA compliance statement. It can be part of the DMCA policy too, but even in content licensing terms, you might note: “We often embed or reference third-party works (e.g., YouTube videos, academic articles via iframe) for educational/commentary purposes. Such content remains under the copyright of the original owners. If you are a rights holder and have an issue with our use of your work, please contact us and we will address the concern promptly (generally within 5–10 business days).” This shows respect for others’ IP and readiness to cooperate, which can prevent conflicts.
Enforcement and DMCA Link: Reiterate that any unauthorized use of the site’s content outside the allowed license will be dealt with. For example, use language that the site owner reserves the right to enforce their copyrights to the fullest extent of the law. This might mean sending cease-and-desist letters or DMCA notices to infringing content on other platforms. Also, provide a pointer to the DMCA Takedown Procedure section/policy for how external copyright holders can notify you, which demonstrates a two-way street (you respect others’ rights and expect others to respect yours).
By having a clear copyright and content reuse policy, krisyotam.com can encourage the sharing of certain content (like AI text and open-source code) under friendly terms, while protecting the original creative works and artwork that the owner values more exclusively. It strikes a balance between openness and control. Always ensure that these rules are easy for users to find and understand, perhaps summarized in plain language (with a table or Q&A format, if needed, for which content is reusable and which isn’t). This way, there’s little ambiguity – users know upfront how they can use the blog’s content, and the owner’s rights are well asserted, creating a strong legal position in case of any infringement.

In order to comply with U.S. copyright law (and analogous frameworks elsewhere) and to secure safe harbor protections, krisyotam.com needs a robust DMCA Notice-and-Takedown Policy. This policy can be a standalone page or section that the Terms of Service references. It should detail how copyright owners can report infringing content on the site, and how those reports will be handled. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) is a U.S. law, but its notice-and-takedown process has become an industry standard globally for handling online copyright issues. Here’s what an airtight DMCA procedure entails:
Designated Agent Contact Information: The site must designate a point of contact (DMCA Agent) to receive infringement notices
copyrightalliance.org
. Provide the agent’s name (or role), mailing address, phone, and email. For example:
DMCA Agent: Kris Yotam (or “Copyright Agent, krisyotam.com”)
Email: dmca@krisyotam.com
Address: [Mailing Address] (It could be a P.O. Box or business address; this will be public.)
This info should be easily accessible – ideally posted on the DMCA policy page and also registered with the U.S. Copyright Office’s online directory if the site is claiming DMCA safe harbor formally. (Registering the agent with the Copyright Office is required to fully benefit from safe harbor in the U.S.
copyrightalliance.org
, and it’s a simple online filing.)
Procedure for Filing a Notice: Outline the requirements for a valid DMCA takedown notice. According to 17 U.S.C. §512(c), a notice must include certain elements
copyright.gov
copyright.gov
. The policy can list these in user-friendly terms:
A clear identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed (or a list of works). For example, “Title of the article or a description of the content you believe was copied.”
The URL or sufficient information to locate the allegedly infringing material on krisyotam.com (e.g., “the direct link to the blog post or image in question”).
A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, their agent, or the law
copyright.gov
 (this is usually language like “I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material described is not authorized…”).
A statement that the information in the notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, the complaining party is the owner of the copyright (or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf)
copyright.gov
. This is essentially the complainer attesting to their claim’s truthfulness.
The physical or electronic signature of the complaining party or their authorized agent
copyright.gov
. If emailed, a typed name can suffice as an electronic signature.
The policy can encourage email submissions (for speed) but also allow mail. Providing a template or link to the U.S. Copyright Office’s sample takedown notice form can be helpful
copyright.gov
copyright.gov
. Make it clear that if any of these elements are missing, the notice might not be processed (this deters incomplete or frivolous claims).
Commitment to Expeditious Removal: State that upon receiving a valid DMCA notice, the site will act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material
copyright.gov
. “Expeditiously” is the language of the law – practically, the owner should strive to take action as soon as reasonably possible (the user mentioned a timeframe of 5–10 business days as a goal, which is reasonable for a personal site). Note that safe harbor expects prompt action to maintain immunity
copyright.gov
. So the policy might say: “Once we receive your notice and verify it contains all required information, we will remove or block access to the reported content quickly, usually within a few days.” It’s also good to mention that the site will notify the user who posted the content (if applicable) of this removal, which is part of the DMCA process
copyright.gov
.
Counter-Notification Process: The DMCA gives the alleged infringer (for example, a user who posted a comment that was removed) a right to respond with a counter-notice if they believe the content was taken down by mistake or misidentification
copyright.gov
. The policy should outline this to be fair and complete. A counter-notice must include: identification of the removed content and its location (URL) before removal, a statement under penalty of perjury that the user believes the content was removed wrongly or has authorization, the user’s contact info, consent to jurisdiction of their local U.S. federal court (if they’re in the U.S., or where the service provider is located if the user is international), and their signature. The policy can simplify: “If you are the content provider and you believe the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification, you may send us a counter-notification. Please include your name, address, and phone, identification of the content and its prior location, and a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief it was removed in error or that you have the right to post it. You must also state you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in [the owner’s district, e.g., Northern District of Illinois] or, if outside the U.S., that you will accept service of process from the person who filed the original DMCA notice.” This last part is a bit legalistic; it basically allows the dispute to potentially go to court. Also explain: if a proper counter-notice is received, the site will forward it to the original complainant and restore the material in 10–14 business days unless the complainant informs that they have filed a court action
copyright.gov
. This mirrors the DMCA timeline (which requires restoration after 10 business days and before 14 business days unless a lawsuit is filed)
copyright.gov
. Including this shows that the site owner understands the balance between copyright owners and users. In practice, for a personal blog, counter-notices might be rare, but having the procedure documented is important.
Repeat Infringer Policy: As noted earlier, to qualify for DMCA safe harbor, the service provider (the site) must have a policy to terminate repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances
copyrightalliance.org
. In the DMCA policy, reiterate that: “Krisyotam.com will terminate, when appropriate, user accounts or subscriptions of users who are repeat infringers.” Even if the site doesn’t have user accounts per se (if commenting doesn’t require login, for example), the policy can state that anyone who repeatedly posts infringing material will be banned from posting further or blocked. It’s good to have already been stated in ToS, but here you affirm it. This demonstrates compliance with §512(i) of the DMCA
copyrightalliance.org
.
Good Samaritan Clause (No Retaliation for Takedown): You might include a note that the site won’t retaliate or take user content down unless there’s a legal notice or clear violation. And that knowingly fraudulent DMCA notices are unlawful (the DMCA has penalties for false claims). While not required, it sets the tone that the process shouldn’t be abused.
Compliance with Other Jurisdictions: Even though DMCA is U.S. law, users from EU, UK, etc., might report copyright issues too. The policy can say that the site respects international copyright laws and will honor legitimate takedown requests from any jurisdiction. European Union has its E-Commerce Directive and upcoming Digital Services Act which similarly expect removal of infringing content once notified, and countries like Canada, Australia have notice systems too. By following the DMCA format, you’re largely meeting those expectations. For EU, you don’t need a separate process – just ensure if an EU resident contacts you about copyright, you handle it with the same promptness.
Timeframe Commitment: The user specifically mentioned aiming to comply with takedown requests in about 5–10 business days. It’s fine to put that in the policy as a general guideline (e.g., “We strive to review and address all copyright notices within 5–10 business days of receipt.”). This sets a public expectation. Just ensure you do try to meet it, as that promise could be seen as part of the agreement with users.
By implementing the above, krisyotam.com will have a DMCA policy that fulfills the legal requirements of section 512 of the U.S. Copyright Act. Importantly, this grants the site owner a “safe harbor” immunity from monetary liability for copyright infringements committed by users or third-party content on the site, provided the owner responds to notices properly and wasn’t aware of the infringement beforehand
copyrightalliance.org
. It protects the blog from being sued for, say, a user’s comment that contained someone else’s text, as long as the blog follows this takedown procedure. Always remember to actually follow through: if a notice comes in, act on it promptly and keep records of notices and actions taken. Lastly, display the DMCA policy prominently (often linked in the footer as “DMCA” or “Copyright”). This transparency not only keeps the site compliant but also deters would-be infringers from using the site for illicit sharing – knowing that the site responds to DMCA notices will discourage misuse.
AI Transparency and Disclosures
With the integration of AI in content creation and site features (such as using fine-tuned models like Kelex for generating prose/verse, or AI assistance in comments), transparency about AI usage is crucial. Both emerging regulations and industry best practices demand that users be informed when they are interacting with AI-generated content or AI systems, rather than a human. Krisyotam.com already has an AI transparency page (/blog/2025/ai-use-cases) explaining the models and their roles – this is an excellent step. To make this aspect truly airtight, consider the following guidelines:
Notify Users of AI-Generated Content: Clearly label content that has been created or significantly assisted by AI. For example, if a blog post or a poem was generated by the Kelex model (perhaps with minimal human editing), it should be disclosed to readers. This could be a line at the top or bottom of the post: “This article was generated with the assistance of an AI model.” The reason is twofold: first, upcoming laws like the EU AI Act will require such transparency. Under the AI Act’s transparency rules, any AI-generated or AI-manipulated content should be identified as artificially generated so users are not misled
artificialintelligenceact.eu
openethics.ai
. The Act specifically says users must be informed when they are interacting with an AI system (unless it’s obvious), and that AI-produced media (images, audio, text, video) should be labeled as AI-generated
artificialintelligenceact.eu
openethics.ai
. Even though the AI Act is EU legislation (expected to fully apply in 2026), being compliant early shows good faith. Second, ethical best practice (supported by AI ethics guidelines worldwide) emphasizes not passing off AI output as human. It maintains trust and allows users to critically evaluate the content knowing its origin.
Disclose AI Assistance in Interactive Features: If comments are AI-assisted – for instance, perhaps the site offers AI-generated suggestions to commenters, or uses AI to moderate/filter comments – inform users about it. For example, “Note: An AI tool may provide suggestions as you write your comment” or “Comments are moderated in part by an AI system to filter spam.” The user experience should make it evident that an AI is involved. In some jurisdictions, this is becoming law: California’s Bot Transparency law prohibits bots from pretending to be human when communicating for certain purposes
fenwick.com
fenwick.com
. While that specifically targets bots in commerce or politics, the principle is general – don’t deceive users about AI vs human. The U.S. FTC has also made it clear that companies must not misrepresent what an AI product is or confuse consumers about whether they’re dealing with a real person or AI
fenwick.com
. The FTC warns that misleading people about AI’s nature can lead to enforcement actions, and it advises being upfront and accurate about AI interactions
fenwick.com
fenwick.com
. So, for krisyotam.com, simple notices like “Powered by AI” icons or textual disclosures can fulfill this.
Explain the Scope and Limits of AI Use: On the AI transparency page (and where relevant throughout the site), explain what the AI models do on the site and what content they affect. For instance, “We use a custom AI model (Kelex built on DeepSeek architecture, akin to GPT) to generate some of our poetry and prose pieces. We also use AI tools for assisting in comment moderation and summarizing discussions.” By providing this information, you comply with transparency expectations and educate the user. The EU AI Act and similar initiatives encourage disclosing “key AI system information,” which can include the fact that content is AI-generated and even summaries of how the AI was trained if high-risk
openethics.ai
openethics.ai
. While a personal blog’s AI would be considered “limited risk” (not making life-critical decisions), there is still a requirement to inform users about the artificial nature of the content or interaction
openethics.ai
openethics.ai
. The site’s AI use-cases page should thus mention each model (Kelex, GPT, Gemini) and the purpose (e.g., content generation, editing assistance, etc.), as well as any measures in place to ensure quality.
Quality and Ethical Assurance: It’s wise to acknowledge that AI-generated content may not be perfect. A best practice is to include a disclaimer like: “AI is used to assist in generating content; while we strive to ensure accuracy and quality, AI-generated text may contain errors or unverifiable information. Readers should be aware and feel free to provide corrections or feedback.” This manages expectations and again aligns with emerging guidelines that AI outputs should not be overly trusted without question (the FTC has noted the risk of “automation bias” where users might trust AI answers too much
fenwick.com
). By being transparent, you empower users to consume AI content with the right mindset. If the owner reviews and edits all AI outputs (which is implied by asserting some copyright), you could also state that: “All AI-generated content is reviewed by the site owner before publication.” That adds assurance that there’s a human in the loop.
AI Model Transparency (for the technically curious): Given the owner is using custom models, some users or regulators might appreciate more detail: e.g., what data was Kelex fine-tuned on (if non-proprietary, you could mention the sources or that it’s trained on the author’s own writings or public domain texts, etc.), and whether any user data goes into AI training or prompts. If, for example, user comments are fed into an AI to generate new content, this intersects with privacy (and should be noted in the Privacy Policy too, that user-provided content may be processed by AI for feature Y). However, if AI models are entirely trained on non-user data, you can clarify that to alleviate privacy concerns. The EU AI Act for limited-risk systems doesn’t force disclosure of training data in detail, but for high-risk it does
openethics.ai
. Even so, voluntary transparency can build trust. The Open Ethics Initiative highlights that transparency includes providing clear information about algorithms and training data to mitigate risks
openethics.ai
openethics.ai
. On a personal blog, this could be as simple as: “Our AI writing model was fine-tuned on a corpus of classic literature and my own prior writings, using the DeepSeek framework,” etc.
AI Usage Policy and User Content: If AI is used to transform user content (say someone inputs a comment and an AI reformulates it), make sure the Terms of Service or AI policy covers intellectual property and consent for that. By using the site’s AI features, a user might need to agree that their input can be processed by AI. And clarify who owns the output (likely the user or the site? Many AI content platforms clarify that the user gets a license to the AI output). For simplicity on a blog, you might just ensure that it’s understood the AI suggestions are just that—suggestions the user can choose to post or not.
Transparency Page Maintenance: Keep the /ai-use-cases transparency page up-to-date as AI capabilities evolve. If new models are deployed or current ones changed (for example, adopting a new version of GPT or a different comment AI filter), update the disclosure. Also, consider adding an FAQ format addressing common questions: “Q: Why do you use AI? A: To enhance creativity and explore ideas with the help of algorithms – but always with human curation.”, “Q: Does AI ever post or comment on its own? A: No, the AI only assists humans and doesn’t autonomously engage with users.” Such clarity pre-empts confusion like “am I chatting with a bot in comments?” etc.
Compliance with AI Accountability Initiatives: Globally, beyond the AI Act, there are frameworks like the U.S. AI Bill of Rights (Blueprint) and the OECD AI Principles that emphasize transparency, accountability, and explainability. While not law, they set expectations. One principle is that automated systems should include “notice and explanation” – people should know when an AI is in use and understand its role. By prominently labeling AI content and providing an explanation on a dedicated page, krisyotam.com aligns well with these principles. It demonstrates that the site is ahead of the curve in responsible AI usage for media.
In summary, clearly inform your audience whenever AI is at play: whether they’re reading an AI-crafted poem, receiving an AI-curated newsletter summary, or interacting with an AI-influenced comment section. This openness will not only meet legal requirements (EU AI Act’s transparency obligations, FTC guidelines, etc.)
artificialintelligenceact.eu
fenwick.com
 but also enhance the site’s credibility. Users tend to appreciate honesty – if they know some content is AI-generated, they can enjoy it for what it is and credit the human for curating it. As one commentary on EU AI compliance notes, transparency “builds trust” and even creates a competitive advantage for those who adopt it early
openethics.ai
. Krisyotam.com, by having an AI transparency section and disclosure practices, shows that it respects its readers’ right to know and is using AI in a conscientious manner.
