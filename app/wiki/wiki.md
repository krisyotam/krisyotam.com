# Kris Yotam: A Personal Wiki

> "Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself, (I am large, I contain multitudes)

## Introduction

This is my personal wiki, a more long-form version of what you saw at [about](/about). It will however introduce several 
things the like are not shown anywhere else on this site. Before we get started I would like to introduce you to some more useful
pages on this site. If you would like to learn about it's design philosophy, & functionality navigate [here](/website). For my in-depth meta-learning 
strategies I have wrote at length about them [here](/learn). If you are interested in the development of my writing style across various formats 
and the philosophy behind it that is [here](/write). Lastly if you are looking for my robust research setup full of custom functionality, analog methods,
and FOSS Software you are welcome to check out [this](/method).


## About Me

I am a writer, developer, and creator with a passion for storytelling, technology, and the intersection of art and science. My work spans multiple disciplines, from fiction writing to web development. If you are interested in viewing a more comprehensive list of my interests there is a "Interests" section on my [about](/about) page. 

# About Page 

I reccomend anyone that has yet to do so visit this page. My [about](/page) page is designed to be a highly modular page that displays some useful information on me. 
So here I will break down what you can find in each tab. 

### About me

In this tab you will find 4 bentos at the top: About Me (A breif introduction to who I am), Connect (A link to the two socials I am most active on), Current Focus (A list of areas I am currently focused on), and Location (A auto updating location (displays current country)). 

Below this you will find a breakdown of my name both pronounciation, and meaning. A mouth full I know. This is proceeded by a 3 tabbed component that displays some basic 
facts about me. There is a Age Calculator which starts at the first second of the minute I was born so there is a 59 second error margin here. On the second tab you will find
my Western Zodiac Sign, & Eastern Zodiac Sign. People tend to ask about these so I decided to just leave them here. The next component is a numerology component that lists
my Life Path Number, Soul Urge Number, & Destiny Number with a breif description of what they mean. For those of you inquisitive types who found something off about this I can assure you they are correct you are just missing some details. 

Below this there is a Currently Reading Section (pulls current information from Tidal), and Currently Listening Section (pulls current information from Literal.club). 
Next is two self explanatory components a word of the day, and quote of the day. The quote of the day component pulls from my personally curated collection of favorite quotes
from books, movies, anime, manga, comics, media, film, or anything else. This is the same pool of quotes displayed on the home page (No there is no way to see a comprehensive list of them at once). 

The final thing in this section is 3 buttons that are accessible only on the about page and here. There is my CV (standard), my profile (a more picturesq view into my life in the aesthetic of a hinge profile), and my Bio Generator (for those who for some reason need a introductory bio for myself). 
- [Curriculum Vitae](/cv)
- [Profile](/profile)
- [Bio Generator](/biogenerator)

### On My Method 

This section includes information on my procedres. There is [On Learning](/learn) which explains my detailed approach to meta-learning, and the tools I use in the process. 
[On Writing](/write) which explains the philosoophy behind my writing and what I am trying to accomplish. [On Method](/method) which explains at length my linux setup, scripts, and automation systems in which I use to streamline research. Lastly [On Website](/website) which covers the philosophy behind this website inspired by [gwern](https://gwern.net). If you are more interested in the design of this website it can viewed [here](/design), and on my [colophon](/colophon) page there is a detailed list of the sites I have taken inspiration from (they may have been updated, or may have been taken down). 

### My Mission

For those interested in my Mission Statement you will find that here. It will likely be updated in the future, but not to much. There is also no date modified tracker. 

### Certifications

Here you will find exactly what you are expecting. A list of certifications with links to a high-res file of each of them. These certifictions come from various platforms
with varying degrees of accrediation, and popularity. Regardless they are all listed here as a personal reference. 

### Experience

I have long tired of the CV style experience sections on sites, nonetheless that really does not work as well with righting anyways. So I have decided upon a more radical approach to this. This experience section is a self-updating tracker of my experience via 12 forms of content. Articles, Newsletters, Nuggets, Notes, Research, Speeches, Books, Keynotes, Quotes, Poems, Characters, Certifications. 


### Practice

As a passionate writer, and ultra-learning I was long in search of a method to steadly improve my various forms of prose. I am glad to say this search came to a decisive end
with the finding of the [Progymnasmata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progymnasmata). This living section is a self-updating tracker of my how many progym excercises I have
completed in each of the 14 categories. 

### Core Skills

Here you can find a detailed list of my skills. Each belong to a category, and you are given 2 views bento, and category. In the bento view you are provided a exhaustive list 
of these skills and their category is only revelaed on hover. In category view the list transforms into a neatly organized list with each skill under it's respective category. 


### Personal Philosophy 

I tried not to ramble on in this section as much as possible, especially due to how heavy the essence of minimalism is in my personal philosophy. This
section details my clear-eyed, no-nonsense approach to life. 

### Areas of Interest

I briefly mentioned this in a earlier section, this is a section that details my areas of interest in field and subfields. 


### Core Values

For those interested in my morals, religion, beleifs, or founding principles this is the secition. I do consider my myself a Christian, however I do not like to associate 
myself with the "Modern Christianity" most belong today. My position is quite simple I consider being a Christian a "Follower of Christ", and via [Ecclesiastes 12:13-14](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ecc/12/13-14/s_671013) that the whole duty of man is to keep the law. For those wondering what this law refers to it is the Mitzvah. 
The 613 Laws, Statues, and Commandments of YHWH. I am not interested in controversial takes or menial discussions surrounding on how it is not practical to try to keep these
laws because it is not socially acceptable. You will also find several other values under this section they all fall under Mitzvah but I am well aware that most of you probably do not know what the mitzvah are. I have a detailed list on a site dedicated to writings more tailored to my faith on this [site](https://saintkris.vercel.app). 


### Companies

Some of you may know that I am a Indie Hacker, I like to ship simple ideas that fix unique issues in specific fields. You will find the information for all of these
companies here, if you are interested in some more in depth information like earning reports that would be [here](/companies). 

### Site Info

I have gotten many inquiries about this site from friends, and acquintances alike. All though at this time I have no interest in making the current version of the site open-source, I will make be making a open-source version of it that cuts the site down to some basic functional pages. For those interested in a step up from this I will
be offering a Paid Version of this site. Lastly at some point I do intend on monetizing the components on this site at some point if you are interested in getting them for cheap or in a bundled deal then stay tuned with section. 

### My Sites 

This site may easily be considered my magnum opus when it comes to writing. However I have a couple other sites that just would not have been practical to merge with this one. There is [khr1st](https://khr1st.vercel.app) which covers aspects related to my programming, cybersecurity, and pentesting that you will not find anywhere else (ctfs, challenges, typing stats, lecture notes, projects, videos, uses, research, ect.). There is also [krispuremath](https://krispuremath.vercel.app), this is both a passion project and one engineered to reinforce information I learn via the LDL Method, and the [Feynman Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_by_teaching). You will also find links to my profiles on various sites like Mastadon, StackOvervlow, MathOverflow, Mathstodon, X, Instagram, LessWrong, Reddit, Quora, 00x0sec, and many more. I can't promise I will be active on some of the more mainstream platforms like "X", or "Instagram" at this time, they really do not suit me. 

### Interesting People 

This happens to be one of my favorite sections on this site. I have longed for a site that catalogs some basic information including the websites of world leading 
writers, poets, socialites, entrepreneurs, chairmen, politicians, academics, scientists, innovators, philosophers, educators, engineers, inventors, historians, activists,
and more. A section of people you should get to know. This is that.
