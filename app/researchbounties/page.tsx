              Sometimes in research, despite my best search techniques, I am unable to get a digital copy of a paper or
              book to upload to Libgen. This page lists my failures to date, and offers bounties for anyone who can get
              me a digital copy of them (often possible via a university ILL department, which are no longer accessible
              to me).
