## Poetry & Poets

| Title / Poet | Pinyin | What it is | Vivien’s take / why start here |
|--------------|--------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **苏轼** | Sū Shì | Song-dynasty master of *cí* lyric poetry | “My idol!!! His poems **and** essays are all gems; his upbeat view of life is worth learning.” |
|  **定风波** | Dìng Fēng Bō | lyric written in exile | See how Su turns hardship into calm humour. |
|   **念奴娇·赤壁怀古** | Niàn Nú Jiāo · Chì Bì Huái Gǔ | lyric on the Red Cliff | Grand historical sweep + personal feeling. |
|   **水调歌头** | Shuǐ Diào Gē Tóu | Mid-Autumn lyric to his brother | The famous “May we share the moon” line. |
| **辛弃疾** | Xīn Qì Jí | Late-Song patriot-poet | His bold military imagery balances Su’s cosmopolitan ease. |
| **李白** | Lǐ Bái | Tang “Immortal of Wine” | For exuberant free-spirited verse; try 《将进酒》. |
| **曹操** | Cáo Cāo | Statesman-poet of the Three Kingdoms | Read 《短歌行》 for the heroic *Jian’an* style. |
| **楚辞** | Chǔ Cí | Warring–States anthology of lyrical verse | On Vivien’s shortlist; good gateway to earlier poetic diction. |
| **人间词话** | Rén Jiān Cí Huà | Wang Guowei’s notes on *cí* aesthetics | Dip in once you’ve sampled Song lyrics – sharp, elegant criticism. |

> **Vivien’s note:**  
> Classic Chinese can feel tough at first; don’t hesitate to read modern annotated editions or bilingual versions. Learning by doing beats endless theory, so write your own verses alongside the reading!
