      <Typography.H1>Typography and Component Features [#typography-heading]</Typography.H1>

      <Typography.Lead>
        This post demonstrates all the typography and component features available in our blog system. You'll find
        examples of headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, and more.
      </Typography.Lead>

      <Typography.H2>Headings [#headings]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>
        Headings help structure your content and make it more scannable. We support four levels of headings, each with
        its own styling. Notice how each heading has an anchor link that appears on hover.
      </Typography.P>

      <Typography.H3>This is a Level 3 Heading [#h3-example]</Typography.H3>

      <Typography.P>
        Level 3 headings are great for subsections within your main sections. They're prominent but don't dominate the
        page.
      </Typography.P>

      <Typography.H4>This is a Level 4 Heading [#h4-example]</Typography.H4>

      <Typography.P>Level 4 headings are perfect for smaller subsections or when you need just a bit more structure.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.H2>Text Formatting [#text-formatting]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>Our blog supports various text formatting options to help you emphasize and structure your content.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.Large>This is large text, useful for important statements or introductions.</Typography.Large>

      <Typography.P>
        This is a standard paragraph. Most of your content will use this style. You can include <Typography.Code>inline code</Typography.Code>{" "}
        within paragraphs when needed, or use <Typography.A href="#">links</Typography.A> to reference other resources.
      </Typography.P>

      <Typography.Small>This is small text, useful for captions, footnotes, or less important information.</Typography.Small>

      <Typography.Muted>This is muted text, which appears in a lighter color to indicate secondary information.</Typography.Muted>

      <Typography.H2>Blockquotes [#blockquotes]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.Blockquote>
        The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard
        chaos. — Edsger W. Dijkstra
      </Typography.Blockquote>

      <Typography.P>Blockquotes are perfect for highlighting quotes or important passages from other sources.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.H2>Lists [#lists]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>
        Lists help organize information in a scannable format. We support both unordered (bullet) and ordered (numbered)
        lists.
      </Typography.P>

      <Typography.H3>Unordered List [#unordered-list]</Typography.H3>

      <Typography.UL>
        <Typography.LI>First item in an unordered list</Typography.LI>
        <Typography.LI>Second item with some additional text to demonstrate how wrapping works with these list items</Typography.LI>
        <Typography.LI>
          Third item with <Typography.A href="#">a link</Typography.A> embedded
        </Typography.LI>
        <Typography.LI>
          Fourth item with <Typography.Code>inline code</Typography.Code>
        </Typography.LI>
      </Typography.UL>

      <Typography.H3>Ordered List [#ordered-list]</Typography.H3>

      <Typography.OL>
        <Typography.LI>First step in a process</Typography.LI>
        <Typography.LI>Second step with some additional explanation that might wrap to multiple lines</Typography.LI>
        <Typography.LI>
          Third step with <Typography.A href="#">a link</Typography.A> for more information
        </Typography.LI>
        <Typography.LI>
          Fourth step with <Typography.Code>inline code</Typography.Code> for a command
        </Typography.LI>
      </Typography.OL>

      <Typography.H2>Code Snippets [#code-snippets]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>Code snippets are essential for technical content. We support both inline code and code blocks.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.Snippet caption="Example JavaScript function">
        {`function calculateSum(a, b) {
// Add two numbers together
return a + b;
}

// Usage example
const result = calculateSum(5, 10);
console.log(result); // Outputs: 15`}
      </Typography.Snippet>

      <Typography.H2>Callouts [#callouts]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>Callouts help highlight important information, warnings, or tips.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.Callout emoji="💡" text="This is a tip callout. Use it to provide helpful suggestions to your readers." />

      <Typography.Callout
        emoji="⚠️"
        text="This is a warning callout. Use it to alert readers about potential issues or things to be careful about."
      />

      <Typography.Callout
        emoji="🔍"
        text="This is an info callout. Use it to provide additional context or background information."
      />

      <Typography.H2>Horizontal Rule [#horizontal-rule]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>A horizontal rule can be used to create a thematic break between sections.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.HR />

      <Typography.P>Notice how the horizontal rule above creates a visual separation between content sections.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.H2>Footnotes [#footnotes]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>
        Footnotes are useful for providing additional information without disrupting the main flow of your content.
        Here's an example of a sentence with a footnote
        <Typography.Ref id="1" />.
      </Typography.P>

      <Typography.P>
        You can add multiple footnotes
        <Typography.Ref id="2" /> throughout your content as needed.
      </Typography.P>

      <Typography.FootNotes>
        <Typography.FootNote id="1">This is the first footnote, providing additional context for the statement above.</Typography.FootNote>
        <Typography.FootNote id="2">
          This is the second footnote, with even more information and a <Typography.A href="#">link</Typography.A> to learn more.
        </Typography.FootNote>
      </Typography.FootNotes>

      <Typography.H2>Figures and Captions [#figures]</Typography.H2>

      <Typography.P>Figures with captions are perfect for including images, diagrams, or other visual elements in your content.</Typography.P>

      <Typography.Figure>
        <img src="/placeholder.svg?height=400&width=600" alt="Example figure" />
        <Typography.Caption>Figure 1: An example image with a caption explaining what's shown.</Typography.Caption>
      </Typography.Figure>
