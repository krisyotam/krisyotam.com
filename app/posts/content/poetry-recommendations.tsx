      </P>

      <H2>Why Poetry Matters</H2>

      <P>
        In our fast-paced digital age, poetry offers a unique opportunity to slow down and engage deeply with language
        and meaning. The concentrated nature of poetry demands our full attention and rewards us with insights that
        often reveal themselves gradually over multiple readings.
      </P>

      <P>
        Poetry teaches us to pay attentionâ€”to language, to our surroundings, to our inner lives. It helps us develop
        empathy by allowing us to experience the world through another's perspective. And perhaps most importantly, it
        reminds us of the power and beauty of language itself.
      </P>

      <H2>How to Approach These Works</H2>

      <P>
        If you're new to poetry, don't feel intimidated by these canonical works. Here are some suggestions for
        approaching them:
      </P>

      <UL>
        <LI>
          Read aloud: Poetry is meant to be heard as well as read. Speaking the words can help you feel the rhythm and
          music of the language.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Start small: You don't need to read an entire collection at once. Begin with a single poem and give yourself
          time to sit with it.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Embrace ambiguity: Unlike prose, poetry often thrives on multiple interpretations. There's no single "correct"
          way to understand a poem.
        </LI>
        <LI>Reread: The best poems reveal new layers of meaning with each reading.</LI>
        <LI>
          Connect personally: Look for moments that resonate with your own experiences or that challenge your
          perspective.
        </LI>
      </UL>

      <P>
        Whether you're discovering these works for the first time or revisiting old favorites, I hope this collection
        enriches your appreciation for the enduring power of poetic expression.
