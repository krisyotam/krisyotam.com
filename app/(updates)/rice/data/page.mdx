# Rice

This is the rice page — a mirror of the changelog/dev layout for short updates.

## How to fetch these scripts

Each snippet below can be fetched directly from my site. Replace `<path-to-script>` with the script path shown on the page and run the appropriate command for your platform.

### Linux / macOS (curl)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://krisyotam.com/updates/rice/<path-to-script> -o script.sh
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://krisyotam.com/updates/rice/<path-to-script>' -OutFile script.ps1"
pwsh ./script.ps1
```

You can include whatever small helper scripts you want under this directory — these examples illustrate how to pull them from the site instead of GitHub.
