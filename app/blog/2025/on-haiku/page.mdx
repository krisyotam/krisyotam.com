# Synopsis

The following post in it's earliest stages will lean heavily on information from 3 all poetry journals I had started when first venturing to conquer the haiku. 
It was the simplest form and such the easiest to get into. So I set my goal to write 100 haikus, and iterate along the way as I learned. That worked well I feel fairly 
confident with them now and it takes around 2 seconds to come up with one. I have no idea if it seems strange I had trouble with coming up with such a simple form in 
the first place that is that, however it is quite true that i sometimes spent an hour on my daily 5 haikus during the early stages of this challenge. Furthermore if 
you are interested in my continuing efforts in producing quality haiku they can be found [here](/poetry/haiku).

The names of the posts aformentioned are "A Thought on Self Learning Haiku", "Haiku: A History", and "Haiku 2: Basic Elements"

# Introduction

Haiku seems to have originated during the 17th century. It was preceded by the poetic format, renga. Matsuo Basho who at the time was considered the master of renga. 
Renga was a collaborative effort which involved one writers responding to the last thing written with a format of 17 and 14 syllabic segments called "on" The 
tone of renga  is witty/innovative/bantering.

here is a example of Renga (by Fujiwara no Teika, 13th century)

<PoemDisplay
  title="Unamed Renga"
  author="Fujiwara no Teika"
  year={1225}
  lines={[
    "The spring night—",
    "The stars in the sky",
    "Faintly flicker.",
    "",
    "Beneath the tree,",
    "The moonlight pours softly",
    "On the blossoms.",
    "",
    "A bird calls from the dark,",
    "Its sound lost in the wind's breath.",
    "",
    "Silent shadows stretch,",
    "As the night grows deep and still."
  ]}
  rhymeScheme={[
    "", "", "", "",
    "", "", "", "",
    "", "", "", ""
  ]}
  meter="Free verse"
  className="my-8"
/>

It was after Basho began to realize that renga was becoming lackluster  and he began to focus on Verse 1: Hokku as a stand alone. One such example is

<div className="flex space-x-4 my-8">
  <PoemDisplay
    title="Autumn Dusk"
    author="Matsuo Bashō"
    year={1689}
    lines={[
      "kare‑da ni",
      "karasu no tomarikeri",
      "aki no kure"
    ]}
    rhymeScheme={["", "", ""]}
    meter="5‑7‑5 syllables"
    className="w-1/2"
  />

  <PoemDisplay
    title="Autumn Dusk (Translation)"
    author="Matsuo Bashō (trans. anon.)"
    year={1689}
    lines={[
      "upon lone branch",
      "a raven perches—",
      "autumn dusk"
    ]}
    rhymeScheme={["", "", ""]}
    meter="Free verse"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>

a later example which Basho used to change switch from a less apathetic tone.

<div className="flex space-x-4 my-8">
  <PoemDisplay
    title="Old Pond"
    author="Matsuo Bashō"
    year={1686}
    lines={[
      "furuike ya",
      "kawazu tobikomu",
      "mizu no oto"
    ]}
    rhymeScheme={["", "", ""]}
    meter="5‑7‑5 syllables"
    className="w-1/2"
  />

  <PoemDisplay
    title="Old Pond (Translation)"
    author="Matsuo Bashō (trans. anon.)"
    year={1686}
    lines={[
      "old pond…",
      "a frog leaps in",
      "water's sound"
    ]}
    rhymeScheme={["", "", ""]}
    meter="Free verse"
    className="w-1/2"
  />
</div>


Basho even went so far as to state that the above was the "poster-child" of the becoming era of haiku. The poem is referred to as "Old Pond".
