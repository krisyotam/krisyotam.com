## Overview
An Oxford World's Classics edition presenting the earliest Greek thinkers, whose ideas laid the foundations of Western philosophy.

## Key Themes

- Metaphysics

- Logic and reasoning

## Notable Thinkers
- Thales
- Anaximander
- Heraclitus
- Parmenides
- Pythagoras
- Empedocles
- Democritus

## Analysis
[Your analysis and notes will go here]

## Philosophical Programming
Here's a simple C program that demonstrates Heraclitus' famous concept of constant change and the impossibility of stepping into the same river twice:

<CodeBlock
  language="c"
  filename="river_of_change.c"
  highlightLines={[4, 7, 8, 9]}
  code={`#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    // The river is never the same
    time_t current_time = time(NULL);
    printf("The river flows at timestamp: %ld\\n", current_time);
    
    // Wait a moment
    sleep(1);
    
    // Try to step in the same river again
    time_t new_time = time(NULL);
    printf("The river has changed: %ld\\n", new_time);
    
    return 0;
}`}
/>

## Long Example: Simulating a Dialogue (Socratic Method)
Here's a longer C program that simulates a simple Socratic dialogue between Socrates and a student, to test the scroll bar for long code blocks:

<CodeBlock
  language="c"
  filename="socratic_dialogue.c"
  code={`#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void socrates_asks(const char* question) {
    printf("Socrates: %s\n", question);
}

void student_answers(const char* answer) {
    printf("Student: %s\n", answer);
}

int main() {
    socrates_asks("What is virtue?");
    student_answers("Virtue is doing good.");
    socrates_asks("And what is good?");
    student_answers("Good is what benefits others.");
    socrates_asks("Is all that benefits others good, even if it harms you?");
    student_answers("Perhaps not always.");
    socrates_asks("So, is virtue always good for the one who is virtuous?");
    student_answers("I suppose it must be.");
    socrates_asks("Then can someone be virtuous and unhappy?");
    student_answers("That seems unlikely.");
    socrates_asks("So, virtue leads to happiness?");
    student_answers("Yes, Socrates, I think so.");
    socrates_asks("Let us continue to examine this further...");
    // ... imagine many more lines of dialogue ...
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {
        socrates_asks("Is this always the case?");
        student_answers("I'm not sure, Socrates.");
    }
    return 0;
}`}
