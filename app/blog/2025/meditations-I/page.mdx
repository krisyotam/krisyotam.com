<Excerpt title="Proverbs 1:1-7" author="Solomon" version="King James Version (1611)" year="1611">
1 The Prouerbes of Solomon the sonne of Dauid, King of Israel,  
2 To knowe wisedome and instruction, to perceiue the words of vnderstanding,  
3 To receiue the instruction of wisdome, iustice, and iudgement & equitie,  
4 To giue subtiltie to the simple, to the yong man knowledge and discretion.  
5 A wise man wil heare, and wil increase learning: and a man of vnderstanding shall attaine vnto wise counsels:  
6 To vnderstand a prouerbe, and the interpretation; the wordes of the wise, and their darke sayings.  
7 ¶ The feare of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles despise wisedome and instruction.

<Dropcap>T</Dropcap>he first thing that strikes me is the adressing of the "Young Man". To the young man it is detailed that this book should give him not 
only **knowledge**, but **discretion** as well. This reminds me of <Bible>Daniel 12:4</Bible> where Daniel says that during the time of the end, knowledge shall
be increased. It does not say the same of discretion. I can personaly attest to this as a young man. One of the most powerful thing's is knowing what you don't know. Today's 
tools allow us to almost immediately identify those gaps. We now have computers with image recognize that can comprehend photos and output information specfic to that of our 
enviornment. LLMs that can parse through your writing, notes, explanations, ect. finding presumed gaps in your knowledge. All of these tools increase the amount of knowledge 
that the average human has the capability to attain, all while decreasing the time needed to attain it. 

<Quote author="Otto Von Bismarck">Only a fool learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.</Quote>

<Dropcap>A</Dropcap>nother thing piercing my heart is the above. One of the thing's that echos inside my is my lack of fulfillment. I desire travel far & wide, and learn a abundance of things. 
To live, and to make my own mistakes. Even to the detriment of myself I have noticed myself becoming somewhat critical of advice given to me by others. Even that which I agree with. 
Almost echoing the trope of "I an call him an idiot all I want. You? You're dead." It's as if my future is my sibling and any advice that goes against the future plans we have is recognized as a 
direct attack on our relationship, and attempt at preventing us from acheiving our goals. It feels this way even with the knowledge that these people know nothing of me, my life, and especially my plans. 


<Quote author="Aristotle">It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.</Quote>

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap>n previous times, I prided myself on having an open mind. I saw myself as someone with a remarkable ability to listen — to reason through another’s thoughts, to understand where they were coming from, 
why an idea made sense to them, and whether it held true empirically or merely anecdotally. This still holds true of me today. It is when I turn inwards and analze the way I feel during this process that in unsettling. Listening is 
not a tool for launching a counter attack, or gaining a tool of superiority over others. This mindset sows wicked seeds regardless of it's lack of immediate outward action <Bible>James 1:19-20</Bible>.
Though I may be the expert in certain engagements, it does not follow that another's idea ought to be dismissed as ignorant before hearing the argument <Bible>Proverbs 18:13, Proverbs 18:15, Proverbs 1:5</Bible>. 



<Excerpt title="Proverbs 1:8-19" author="Solomon" version="King James Version (1611)" year="1611">
8 My sonne, heare the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.  
9 For they shall be an ornament of grace vnto thy head, and chaines about thy necke.  
10 ¶ My sonne, if sinners entise thee, consent thou not.  
11 If they say, Come with vs, let vs lay wait for blood, let vs lurke priuily for the innocent without cause:  
12 Let vs swallow them vp aliue, as the graue, and whole, as those that goe downe into the pit:  
13 Wee shall finde all precious substance, wee shall fill our houses with spoile:  
14 Cast in thy lot among vs, let vs all haue one purse:  
15 My sonne, walke not thou in the way with them; refraine thy foot from their path:  
16 For their feete runne to euil, and make haste to shed blood.  
17 Surely in vaine the net is spread in the sight of any bird.  
18 And they lay wait for their owne blood, they lurke priuily for their owne liues.  
19 So are the waies of euery one that is greedie of gaine: which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
