# About Me

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap>f you are looking for a more concise, or even perhaps aesthetically pleasing presentation of this information although more limited. I beseige you to check 
the carefully assembled [about page](/about). In this page I will try to give the rather uninteresting answers to Who are you?, What have you done?, Where are you online?, and other 
typical questions a proper about page should answer. If you were looking for something more up to date about specific goals for the month I have a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) 
which is located [here](/now).

### Gaming 

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap> will do a writeup detailing my history gaming at a later date and try to reconstruct some fun info with it (stats, screenshots, clips, montages, ect.) I am positive there is tons of data around on 
old drives. Currently I don't game to much. I am experimenting with WriteWarz, and Thinking about getting into OSU!. I have returned to geometry dash but am fairly bad now. I am able to feasibly complete 
some Hard Demons with decent time sink but that is a upper limit. I am fairly sure I'm done with EpicGames for the time being. However the client is still installed and I still accept friend requests. 
I am out the money for a vr headset right now but I do plan on getting another Meta Quest 3, and I willingly accept requests via the app. I also periodically check vrchat friend reqeusts via steam until I get a new headset. 

Epic Games:

# Philosophy 

<Dropcap>H</Dropcap>ere I will try to stick to a overhead view of my personal philosophy. I will go into some depth realting to topics such as Minimalism, Asceticism, 
Rationalism, Slow Living, Intentional Living, Classical Education, Quietism, Stoicism, and Ad Fontes Living. I realize those are fairly blanket terms, and there is really
nothing to be done about such in regards to giving a accurate preview of what is to come. What has been excluded from this to be covered in other posts are my [philosophy on programming](), 
[philosophy of physical sciences]() detailing my approach to (mathematics, logic, and computer science), [Forms of Thinking]() catalouging my approach to learning, [philosophy on systems]() covering my phliosophy on software and hardware systems, 
and [toward a literary life]() which covers my approach to literature.

### Minimalism 

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
>  
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap> thought I would cover this first as Minimalism is the most foundational of the philosophies, and most integral to my mental health, and way of being. By way of my obsessive learning style 
based on [Scott Young's Ultralearning](). Unecessary complexity can cause a lot of problems in my life via [Decision Fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue). It's because of this that I tailor my 
life as much as possible around [proactive planning](/blog/2025/on-practive-planning) of future needs. [Overstimulation]() happens to be another dangerous thing following maximalism. It is detrimental to anyone 
looking to lead a dedicated, fulfilled, and focused life. By way of decreasing attention span. Devices, unwanted meetings, and relationships you don't even care about can cause [Productive Procrastination](/blog/2025/on-productive-procrastination). 
I am truly not the biggest fan of real life ads. 

> People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time, they are the most wasteful of the one thing in which is it right to be stingy.  
> — Seneca  

As Seneca says people are far to profuse when it comes to the time they are willing to give menial things. At the risk of sounding caustic, I am very <Define>fastidious</Define> with the things I allow to take up my time. My goal is to create a contant flux of 
positive food through the senses (Auditory, Olfactory, Gustatory, Tactile, Visual). People put obscene thought into diet plans but little think about the diet of the other senses. Hearing, Seeing, Smelling, or Touching the wrong the thing 
can take hours of focus away from one's day at best, and months at worst. So it is best to be overly cautious when it comes to the type of person you are and the things you consume both actively, and unconctiously. 

### Asceticism 

<Dropcap>M</Dropcap>y approach to asceticism is multimodal coming from a religious point of view as a Christian the rather ironic driving force of my life is wisdom, and understanding. 
As we can see in <Bible>Proverbs 4:7-9</Bible>, Wisdom & Understanding should be exalted. The most important form of this being wisdom, and understanding
for purpose of practical application of the [Mitzvah](https://www.jmu.edu/dukehallgallery/exhibitions/2018-2019/the-613-mitzvot.shtml). As far as I am aware this is a somewhat 
controversial take that people must keep the law? Or rather a convuluted one on what the law is, as most christians don't traditionally seem to think that sin is ok. This is not something 
I plan on covering here but in another post at a later date. I do however feel it is worth mentioning that my belief in living a legalistic life can be derived from <Bible>Ecc 12:13-14</Bible>.
My natural goals can be most elegantly summed up as <Quote author="Ada Lovelace">“I never am really satisfied that I understand anything; because, understand it well as I may, my comprehension can only be an infinitesimal fraction of all I want to understand about the many connections and relations which occur to me, how the matter in question was first thought of or arrived at, etc., etc.”</Quote>
As such it is in my interest to evade the numerous forms of <Define>vanity</Define> <Bible>Ecc 1:2</Bible>.

# Diet

<Dropcap>T</Dropcap>he one eats is the way one thinks. A sentiment I picked up from the late Nicola Tesla who stressed the importance of high-quality food, preferring fresh vegetables, 
fruits, legumes, milk, and egg whites. He avoided egg yolks and acid producing foods, believing they could impair health and mental function. He directly linked his diet as the sustaining
force behind his <Define>veracious</Define> work ethic. Even being adamant about the avoidance of stimulants such as coffee, tea, and tobacco considering them harmful to both physical and mental 
well-being. I share his conviction of some of the harsher stimulants like (tobacc), and in others like coffee I am currently more torn on. I am completely opposed to the open disdain of tea however 
and do not plan on living a life without it. I am in a phase of my life where as a young adult I lack much of the stability that many have in there later years, and tend to throw myself entirely at 
work. Writing, Developing, Researching, Studying, ect. from sometimes 10-12 hours at a time with 1-2 meals a day, and a lot of tea to sustain me. This has done no benefits to me as I have suffered from 
Sleep Apnea, Microsleep Blackouts, and Sleep Paralysis. Admittely most of my unconventional polyphasic sleep of around 3-4 hours per day comes from these Microsleep Blackouts, and the Sleep Paralysis from 
my mind being ready to get back to work while my body lies wholly opposed. I am currently into research about correcting my diet so I will share some of what is planned now. 

The goal is to rely upon a more Alkaline Diet. The theory is that acidic foods cause [acidosis](), and mucus in the body leaving a breading ground for harmful bacteria and disease. In short that this 
can all be avoided with some form of Naturalist diet relying on mostly fruit and vegitables. At the current time I have no plans of converting in full to such a diet. The claims are interesting, and from 
anecodotal evidence I can even vouch for the short term results. However only raw uncooked fruits, and vegitables is out of the realm of plausiblity for me currently. I am leaning toward something more simialar 
to what is seen on [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uPxj32epDQ). Something of this sort allows me to continue to polish my culinary ability, learn about various cultures of food, and to eat a healthy 
diet routinely without lack of variety. I do not plan on using this as dogma either however. I intend on enjoying the occasional [French Silk Pie](https://gbskitchen.com/french-silk-pie-an-american-classic-since-1951/).
This leneancy should not do to much damage as I am rather tame on the sweets in the first place, and have alkaline alternative to practically any normal meal I'd ever eat. The only thing here is meat. I'd like to 
have a proper discussion on this topic in the future. At the moment I will continue to eat chicken, beef, and turkey. With the exception of pork <Bible>Leviticus 11:7-8</Bible>.
