## Introduction

Susanna Kaysen's portrayal in the 1999 film "Girl, Interrupted" offers a compelling window into the complexities of mental health treatment in the late 1960s. Based on Kaysen's own memoir of the same name, the film chronicles her 18-month stay at McLean Hospital following a suicide attempt. Winona Ryder's nuanced performance captures the character's journey from confusion and rebellion to self-awareness and eventual healing.

## Character Background

Diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder at age 18, Susanna represents the archetypal "troubled young woman" of her era. Her diagnosis comes at a time when women's emotional responses to societal constraints were often pathologized. The film portrays her as intelligent and creative but struggling to find her place in a world with rigid expectations for young women.

## Narrative Arc

Susanna's character development follows a classic journey of self-discovery:

1. **Initial Resistance**: Upon admission to Claymoore Hospital (based on McLean), Susanna rejects her diagnosis and the institution itself.

2. **Peer Relationships**: Her complex friendship with Lisa (Angelina Jolie) represents both the allure of rebellion and its destructive potential.

3. **Therapeutic Progress**: Through interactions with Nurse Valerie (Whoopi Goldberg) and Dr. Wick (Vanessa Redgrave), Susanna gradually confronts her self-destructive patterns.

4. **Transformation**: By the film's conclusion, she develops the self-awareness necessary to leave the institution and pursue a writing career.
