# How They Fall 

<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">C</Dropcap>lick-clack... it was best known that the miller kids were quite placid, and of humble origin. If it were under any other circumstances this story would not see the light of day, 
for fear of my life. It is in response to this fear; this cowardly debilitating fear that I must tell of the Miller kids. So it my breaks my heart that they would be the subject of the press today. It was 1875 in Warwickshire England, 
william the son of lori & adam morris begged his parents for one of the newly released gadgets. A typewriter they called it. The Morrises did well for themselves, they weren't in debt, owned a home, produced there own food, and easily 
met their daily needs. However since their kids were born they gave up everything to savings in hopes of giving their children a better life. 

<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">W</Dropcap>illiam dashed into the kitchen heart pounding; with a flush face. "MAMMA!," William Said, "I must have a type writer". Adam frowned "You have a pencil, and enough paper for a print shop. What need have you for this trinket?".
"Well darling your father is right, what can this machine do that a pencil can't?". Will sighed "Ive saved up my money for 3 years, i only need [] mamma please." Adam sat his glass down, "Lower your voice boy. It's to early for all of that hollering." "How about this." Lori said, 
"I can give you []". Will dishearteningly pouted, "It won't be enough" he said. Lori's heart broke as Will ran out the door. "Hes worked so hard all these years." she mumbled. "He'll get over it by dinner said adam. Trinkets come and go, work is permenant. If you don't work you don't eat, and that's that."
