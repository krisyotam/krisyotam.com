## Key Insights

Carter G. Woodson published this groundbreaking work in 1933, addressing how the American education system of his time failed to properly educate African Americans. His insights on the systemic issues in education remain relevant today, as he critiqued:

- How education was designed to maintain social hierarchies
- The importance of culturally responsive teaching
- How historical narratives shape identity formation
- Why critical thinking must be central to true education

## The Dark Side  
  
When I reflect on the title of this work  
The Mis-Education of the Negro  
I'm drawn to the careful examination  
Of systems built to maintain the status quo  
  
A century has passed since Woodson's words  
Yet many truths within them still remain  
His call for critical pedagogy  
To break the chains of mental slavery  
  
Education must not merely conform  
But liberate the mind to question all  
To find one's history and identity  
And build a future standing proud and tall
