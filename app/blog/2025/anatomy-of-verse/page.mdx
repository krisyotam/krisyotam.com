# Introduction

Humbly speaking, and In antithesis to my earlier work I happen to be of the opinion that rhyme, structure, and chiefly meter seperate verse from simply being 
concise, yet evocative prose. Not that there is any shame to the latter. 

> “No verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job.”
> — T. S. Eliot

The above quote from T.S. Eliot perfectly expresses my opinion of the topic. I maintain that most who disregard meter in it's importance to verse do so 
not because of it's scant importance, rather due to the deliberate complexity it brings to the act of composition. 

> "True ease in writing comes from art, not change, As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance...
> the sound must seem an echo to the sense." — Alexander Pope

Rather than succumb to [inquietude](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/inquietude_n?tab=factsheet#316284), I assert that it is best to push yourself beyond what you formerly thought yourself capable of. Analogous to that of the tearing of [sarcomeres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcomere), just as they must thicken through hypertrophy so should 

# Rhyme

I consider Rhyme the most basic element of verse even more so than structure. This is due to it's relative ease, yet subtle and powerful influence in even the shortest of verse. There happens to be quite a few methods of rhyme which I will display to you now. 

First are those in which we measure through there placement/position in the text

#### End Rhyme
a Rhyme that takes place at the end of lines.

>  Tyger! Tyger! burning **bright**,  
>  In the forests of the **night**

*The Tyger, William Blake*

---

#### Internal Rhyme
Rhyme within a single line.

> Once upon a midnight **dreary**, while I pondered, weak and **weary**

*The Raven, Edgar Allen Poe*

Those that tend to be more commonly known are ones referred to by Quality of Sound

---

#### Perfect (Full) Rhyme
Exact match of vowel + following consonant(s).

> The woods are lovely, dark and **deep**,  
> But I have promises to **keep**

*Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, Robert Frost*

---

#### Slant (Near or Half) Rhyme
Vowel or consonant sounds are similar but not identical.

> My life had stood – a Loaded **Gun**–
> In corners – till a **Day**

*My Life had stood – a Loaded Gun, Emily Dickinson*
