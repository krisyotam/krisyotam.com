# On Improvement 
<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">I</Dropcap>t wouldn't be far fetched to say that my entire life is geared toward self improvement. What self improvement means 
for me may very well differ from what it means to a lot of you, but one thing remains the same. That to improve you must learn to become better at the hobbys, habits, 
and actions that make the ideal you. However there is only so good you can get at one thing before that skill starts to plateu in the results it provides you. This is 
really only natural. Most enlglish speaking native adults know 20,000-30,000 out of the 600,000 words in the Oxford English Dictionary. That is less than 5.83% of the total words. Yet 
most english native adults aren't likely to run into a situation in which there are no words in there vocabulary that suffice for such a situation. Maybe in some highly 
speclized events, or conferences. Certaintly not often. So then the question becomes when one plateus in self improvement through mastery to a certain point. How do you 
get back to big consistant gains? This is where "Identifying the Unknowns" come into play. 

# On Unknowns 
<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">U</Dropcap>nknowns are boundless ideas that can give you rapid ability to break a plateu. They can offer various unique innovations that 
you would never have considered, and transform you greatly as a person if applied pratically. One of these such unknowns is the [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). 
It transformed the way I dealed with 404 pages on this site view an example [here](/doc). It has also been implemented in several other scripts I use, and has been a life saver overall. Unknown Gems 
like this aren't the only type that I hunt for though. For example I currently (5/14/2025) working on a piece on Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild. By extension I became quite interested to 
Beatrice Ephrussi de Rothschild. Naturally all I knew of her was the very little in relation to her work on Villa Ephrussi. Situations like these leave tons of unknowns. The best part is 
they are simple unknowns. As in you don't know what they are, but you do know exactly what you don't know. For ex. I know I would like to know about her early life, marriage, other chateus, life as a curator, ect.
So this is exactly what I design prompts for. 

# Fishing for Common Unknowns 
<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">C</Dropcap>ommon unknowns as I call them are a two shot process. First I take any [reasoning model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoning_language_model) and clarify my thoughts 
on the topic. This doesn't require the most intelligent prompting. Simple things like "Clarify my thoughts on x, and use Inductive Reasoning to extrapolate what you think I want to know on said topic. Format each point 
as a single idea in bullet points." Something like this does well to clarify your thoughts so you can at a moment be exposed to all of the information about a topic that there is to know. You can continue expanding the list 
if you are not satisfied with it after the first prompt. Although for most topics the first prompt seems to be overcomprehensive for what I am looking for. The next step is to set up deep-research prompts. I will be 
storing these in a [github repo](https://github.com/krisyotam/prompts) as I find they are useful to return to. However the results of all of my deep searches are available [here](/docs). 


# Fishing for Unknown Gems 
<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">F</Dropcap>ishing for unknown gems is quite a bit trickier. If you are comfortable with it I recommend feeding the model a dossier about yourself. Ethnicity, age (age group/generation), 
interests, past projects, ect. the more information here the better. Then using a prompt like [this will suffice](/prompts/potential-unknowns.txt). I have no idea what this prompt looks like at the moment you are seeing it. 
As I will be doing a substantive overhaul of the current version. Regardless it should work quite well for finding unknown gems.
