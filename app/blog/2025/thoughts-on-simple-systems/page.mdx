<Box>The following is a discussion on my thoughts about the implementation of simple systems 
that allow me to have mobility around the globe without sacrificing the quality of what I do digitally. If you are 
unfamiliar to what my previous setup was check /blog/2025/uses-this where you can view my 2024 setup. Even though I have 
procured some pieces of the new setup you see listed for 2025. At the moment I am still largely reliant on my previous setup. </Box>

<Collapse title="Why a simple setup?">My goal in life beyond that of <Bible>Ecc 12:13</Bible>, is to learn. To learn far and wide, and was much 
as possible. And what is learning without practical apllication of the skills gained? In other words not only do I want to learn far and wise, but travel
equally far, and wide. I want to experience various cultures, and gain inspiration for the things I do. This does not mean In any way that I want to sacrifice 
all the things I love i.e. blogging, programming, ctfs, research, ect. However a lot of those things require a lot of compute power to be done efficiently at the least.
So the goal is here is to strategically replace the geographical liabilities in mysetup (4 monitors, massive pc tower, ect.) with a more simple setup (2012 macbook pro) 
that allows me to outsource compute to a variety of Hetzner products I will discuss in this post.</Collapse>

# On Mobility 
<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">M</Dropcap>obility is the first, and foremost issue to tackle in a setup for a nomad. It is plausible for some nomads to bring 
desktop setups with them, and expenses can vary greatly depending on where one is coming from and to where they are going. This depends on the lifestyle that you plan 
on living in your destination. For me that life style looks like constant travel. Studying at a beach, research at various libraries, ect. So I have opted to go with my 
favorite laptop as my [daily driver](/blog/2025/on-the-2012-macbook-pro).
