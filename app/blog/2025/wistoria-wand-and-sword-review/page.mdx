# Introduction 

<Dropcap>F</Dropcap>ew narratives captivate quite like Wistoria. It is a visual storytelling masterclass. Wistoria has some of the most fluid, and consistant animation. My favorite
scene being either [Will vs. Prof Edward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE6IiPtwaMg&pp=ygUXV2lsbCB2cyBlZHdhcmQgd2lzdG9yaWE%3D), or the 20 second attack [Lihanna performs against the Grand Duke](https://9animetv.to/watch/wistoria-wand-and-sword-19239?ep=128228) around 10:20,
bringing to mind a scene in the Jinwoo vs. Beru fight. Of course a horable mention to [Will vs. Julius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMOGiWGPBTQ&pp=ygUOd2lsbCB2cyBqdWxpdXM%3D) 
a fan favorite that was excellently executed. 

# A well-worn concept, newly refined

> Ideas are easy. Execution is everything.  
> ― John Doerr, Measure What Matters

<Dropcap>M</Dropcap>agic High School, Star Crossed Lovers, Unrequited Love, & the Magically Inept Fighter we have all seen this before. The power in this story is not 
in it's appreciation for the extraordinary but it's extradinary execution of the ordinary. Regarden Magical Academy and it's seperation from the Upper Institute is a perfect
setup. The Division of credits between the areas of writing, practical training, and practical skill is also well executed. As we can see that the world heavily favors magic 
in the subtle point distinction in practical skill which is gained through magical ability relative to the other areas.

# Favorite Characters 

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap> could talk at length about my favorite characters in this show. Perhaps I will after finishing this review, and my character analysis of Sion, and Wignall. however
that is a topic for another post. Wistoria astonishes me with it's persistent ability to anchor me emotionally to characters. Nevertheless in this review, and the anime reviews I make 
going forward I have decided to limit my choices for favorite characters to a limit 4 for both brevity and symbolic weight as the more favorites sort of lessens the impact. The four 
I have narrowed the list down to are [Elfaria Albis Serfort](https://wistoria.fandom.com/wiki/Elfaria_Albis_Serfort), [Workner Norgram](https://wistoria.fandom.com/wiki/Workner_Norgram), 
[Lihanna Owenzaus](https://wistoria.fandom.com/wiki/Lihanna_Owenzaus), and [Iris Stellamaris](https://wistoria.fandom.com/wiki/Iris_X._Stellamaris). 


### Prof. Workner
<Dropcap>O</Dropcap>ut of my favorites it is Prof. Workner that easily ranks the highest amongst the pile. He is the greatest prof. I've never had. Even in spite of 
will's outlandish goals going against everything most would consider a **rational minded** adult to think a productive use of time. He seems to truly understand how 
will feels, and convey empathy to him. He is immediately able to look past his own presuppositions of who can & can't become a Magia Vander to help Will in his goal. 
Even still he is able to maintains the rationale of Will's siutation explaining that one needs **7200** credits out of a possible **12,000** to qualify for the Upper
Academy at Mercedes Caulis (Sorcerer's Tower). As for the categories you are able to earn **3,600** credits via Writing (筆記), **3600** via Practical Training (実習, “Praxis”), and **4,800**
via Practical Skill (実技, “Spellwork”). Knowing this he is able to keep will grounded in the fact he must first focus on graduate to gain access to the Upper Institute. 
Only then will he have any shot at Magia Vander. A further example clarifying my high regard for Prof. Workner is the conversation between Will, and Colette
that takes place during **Season 1, Episode 2**. This converstaion is right after the lecture given by Prof. Workner where he mentions that "Everyone here is in danger
of not making graduation. Much less the Upper Institute! So today, I will thoroughly drill you in supplementary lessons!". In this conversation Colette mentions she 
heard that Workners class was unreal again. Where Will responds with "We did everything from consecutive mock exams to rigirous magic instruction." A little later in 
the conversation Will says that "Professor Workner is kind to give us supplementary lessons at all. Most professors wouldn't give us a second thought." Colette seems
to immediately reinforce this notion saying "Thats true. Professor Edward in particular doesn't seem like he'd ever bother with extra classes." This statement reveals 
volumes about Workners empathy, conviction, and integrity. We can make a fair assumption that giving this oppurtunity to his students lends nothing to his carrer advancement, 
status, or social credit with relation to his peers. 

### Lihanna Owenzaus
> To every man upon this earth   
>  Death cometh soon or late.  
>  And how can man die better  
>  Than facing fearful odds,  
>  For the ashes of his fathers,  
>  And the temples of their Gods?  
> — Thomas Babington Macaulay, “Horatius” in Lays of Ancient Rome

<Dropcap>L</Dropcap>ihanna Owenzaus more commonly refferred to as Miss Perfect (完璧才女, Misu Pāfekuto) throughout the early story is one of the most dilligent characters in the series. Not once is she shaken up 
by the praise she got from other students as a member of the big 3 (Julius, Lihanna, Wignall). Her given nickname is a nod to her valedictorian status having achieved a maximum of 12,000 credits at 
Regarden. She shows exceptional poise at all times, and is a forward thinking individual. The strongest example of this is in **Season 1, ep 10** during her conversation with Colette. 
Lihanna says "Being scouted at the festival, or inveting new spells. A real talent finds a way to advance without caring about the graduation process. For the past six years,
all I've done is watch the backs of such people. We're literally the leftovers .", here she provides a calm level-headed analysis of how she views her own standing. She does 
not see herself as gifted, talented, and much less perfect. She does not permit public praise to inflate unwarranted pride in her accomplishments. This is further reinforced by a similar 
conversation taking place in **Season 1, episode 8** where Will says "You have a guarunteed post-graduation placement. Why go to all this trouble?". To which Lihanna responds
"Because we, who are still in the Academy, are the leftovers. In other words, the inferiors." following this she reveals some crucial details about her motivations for pushing so hard, and 
her pursuit of Magia Vander. She begins saying "I am from House Owenzaus. The memebers of our family generally die young. To prevent our ruin, I need to dliver overwhelming results.
Simply ascending the Tower won't be enough. When it comes to it, I have to become a Magia Vander. Surely I can't be the only one with ambitions here?". This reveals that her 
isatiable drive, and meticulous choice in teammates was all geared toward one goal. Pursuit of Magia Vander to save the Owenzaus Family from Ruin. Her entire life is a selfless 
pursuit of restoring her family. Despite this in **Season 1, episode 11** during the fight with the Grand Duke, Lihanna tells her party "Ill stop this, even if it costs my life."
in response to this collete says "What are you saying, Lihanna?" where Lihanna proceeds her dialogoue "I'm the one who failed to kill it, so I must do it. Do you know why members of House Owenzaus often die young? 
Because as knights, we have to protect our comrades." Not only does she live for saving her family. Even in the face of death and the loss of everything she was willing to lay down
her life out of conviction of her ideals.

### Elfaria Albis Serfort

> "Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see"  
> — Arthur Schopenhauer 

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap>n **Season 1, Episode 2** during Prof. Workner's Lecture he mentions that when one says "Climb the Tower" they are usually referencing Ascension to the Upper Institute. 
In order to become a Magia Vander. He further explains that there are two principal methods of advancement. The first is to create a new type of magic, The second is to 
earn at least seventy-two hundred credits at the academy. Furthermore that "Only a limited number of people can achieve the former, Which means that the majority of students
must rely on the latter."

Some people get a taste of success and forget the kitchens they starved in. The former mindset and idealogy of the Albis Vena, Elfaria Albis Serfort are diametrically opposed. 
It is revelaed to us in backstory that Elfaria is the youngest to ever become a Magia Vander. <Spoiler>She became a Magia Vander at the age of 10</Spoiler>

- mention that elfaria became a magia vander (youngest ever), during the years that Lihanna was in 3-4 year.


### Iris Stellamaris

> "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid."
> — Albert Einstein

<Dropcap>I</Dropcap>ris Stellamaris a Watcher for the Magia Vander, currently on assignment under the guide of Iris Churchill to monitor Will's progress is a paragron of strength, and integrity. She judges people 
not on what they lack but on what they can offer society. In the end of **Season 1, ep 3** we see Iris walking through the halls of Mercedes Caulis (The Wizard's Tower) approaching the throne room 
of the Magia Vander. As she walks we hear her inner dialogue as she says to herself "He can't use magic, but the way he compensates is creative. And he has a nose for battle back by experience.
It's true he's not mage, but he's a talented warrior." Pushing open the doors she enter's the throne room. As [Zeo](https://wistoria.fandom.com/wiki/Zeo_Thorzeus_Reinbolt) asks her "How's everything on your side, Watcher?
You found anyone worth using?". She reponds saying "During my search at the Academy, I found an interesting prospect. A no-talent who can't use magic. His name is Will Serfort. I recommend that he be brought into the tower."
We can infer from this moment that Iris does not simply assess based on outcomes, but on latent potential, often invisible to most. She does not wait for consensus. Nor does she hedge her recommendation. 
In fact, this kind of measured but confident endorsement suggests she has made calls like this before. She trusts what she sees—even when others do not. While the show does not provide as much backstory for her as it does for others, 
this single moment implies much. Her willingness to go against expectation, to vouch for someone universally disregarded, tells us that Iris possesses a private integrity rooted in judgment, not conformity. She sees not just what someone is, 
but what they could become—and in a world ruled by hierarchy, that alone places her in a rare class.
