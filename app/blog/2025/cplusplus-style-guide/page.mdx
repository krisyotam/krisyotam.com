<Collapse title="Purpose of Guide">
For those wondering I intend on using C++ strictly for competitive programming. I am learning C, Python, and Bash to take care off a number 
of other issues such as my planned open source contributions, scripting, and data analysis. So while I may have a abundance of usecases that arise for the C++ language at a later date. 
The state of this guide is for practical C++ use in Competitive Programming.

<Collapse title="Where to find me">
I have not completely decided on how I will split my time or the practice of certain languages and on which platforms. However you can currently find me on the platforms 
below which over the next year (05/04/2025) should all see at least some use.

<Box>I have abstracted my [coding philosophy](/blog/2025/a-manifesto-for-holistic-computing) into a post that covers my philosophy for hardware, software, and coding as these tend to be language independant frameworks.</Box>
