  lines={[
    "Do not go gentle into that good night,",
    "Old age should burn and rave at close of day;",

    "Though wise men at their end know dark is right,",
    "Because their words had forked no lightning they",
    "Do not go gentle into that good night.",

    "Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright",
    "Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,",
    "Rage, rage against the dying of the light.",

    "Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,",
    "And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,",
    "Do not go gentle into that good night.",
    "",
    "Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight",
    "Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,",
    "Rage, rage against the dying of the light.",
    "",
    "And you, my father, there on the sad height,",
    "Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.",

## Structure and Form

The poem follows a traditional structure with two quatrains separated by a blank line. Each quatrain employs a simple AABB rhyme scheme, creating a sense of harmony and balance. The meter is consistently iambic tetrameter throughout, giving the poem a rhythmic quality that mimics the gentle awakening described in the content.

## Imagery and Symbolism

Northwood's use of imagery is particularly striking in this poem. The opening lines establish a transition from darkness to light, symbolizing not just the literal dawn but also spiritual awakening and renewal. The "dew-kissed petals" suggest freshness and purity, while the "chasing shadows" implies the triumph of light over darkness.

## Historical Context

Written in 1923, this poem emerged during a period of significant social and cultural change following World War I. The emphasis on renewal and fresh beginnings can be read as a response to the collective trauma of the war years, offering hope and the promise of new beginnings.

## Conclusion

"Whispers of Dawn" demonstrates Northwood's mastery of traditional poetic forms while infusing them with imagery that resonates with the modernist sensibility of her time. The poem's enduring appeal lies in its ability to capture a universal moment of transition and hope through precise, evocative language.
