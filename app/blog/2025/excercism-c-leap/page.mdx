# Exercism: leap

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

- In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.  
- Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it’s only a leap year if it’s also evenly divisible by 400.

**Some examples:**
- 1997 was not a leap year (not divisible by 4).  
- 1900 was not a leap year (divisible by 100 but not 400).  
- 2000 was a leap year!

# Solution

```c
#include "leap.h"
#include <stdbool.h>

bool leap_year(int year) {
    return (year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0);
}
```

My solution reduces the entire check to this single return expression:

```c
return (year % 4 == 0) && (year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0);
```
