Oh, Debutante your radiance gleems,
The inside flows out like a marvelous stream.
Thy Missive reaches me, even as my heart averts thou,
My words freeze up if only I could convert thine.

Your brusque illudes me,
Still your warmth includes me.
A sense of folly it gives me,
Until our next meet a tally I keep thee.

Your presence inspires me,
I shall acquire thee.
Thy morals are worn,
Like garments untorn.

Thou beauty is peerless,
To defend it I will be fearless.
To meet you I must fall,
To forgo ego lest I stall.
