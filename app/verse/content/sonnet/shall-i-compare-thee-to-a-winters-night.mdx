Shall I compare thee to a winter's night?
Thou art more cruel and keen in thy sting.
A bitter breeze doth seize November light,
and winter's reign hath far too strong a cling.

A soul beguiled by snow in chilling clasp.
By night, heaven reveals it's clearest view.
Enough that I'd now yield to heaven's grasp,
and yet even still ice be frozen through.

While splinters of scorn fall like winter hail.
My pride, it fades as winter tows its cost.
Those eyes of glass that froze me in her stare.
A harsh reminder, with a heart of frost.

Not flame nor time dare try to reach to thee.
Sublime! A glance that froze the sun had she.
