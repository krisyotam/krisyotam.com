Welcome to my "wants" page. This is a simple list of things I'm looking to purchase. If you happen to have any of 
these items and are willing to sell, please [contact me](mailto:contact@krisyotam.com).

## Why This Page Exists

I believe in giving pre-loved items new homes rather than always buying new. Many of these items have historical significance, craftsmanship, or qualities that aren't replicated in modern equivalents. If you have something on this list and are interested in selling, please reach out!

**Note:** I'm always adding to this list as my interests evolve. Check back periodically for updates.
