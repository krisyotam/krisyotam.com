# House of Fairchild

> And I remarked as to why? Why he would do something so cruel?


## Prologue: The Invitation

The letter arrived on a Tuesday, its envelope thick and cream-colored, addressed in an elegant script that seemed to belong to another century. Eliza Winters turned it over in her hands, noting the wax seal bearing an intricate crest—a tree with branches that twisted to form what looked like a face.

*Miss Winters,*

*Your presence is requested at Fairchild Manor on the occasion of the reading of Mr. Edmund Fairchild's last will and testament. As a distant relation through your maternal grandmother, you have been named in the document. Your attendance is required on the 21st of October. Accommodations will be provided for a stay of three nights.*

*Yours sincerely,*
*Thaddeus Blackwood, Solicitor*

Eliza frowned. She had never heard of Edmund Fairchild, nor was she aware of any family connections to a manor house. Her grandmother had died when Eliza was just a child, leaving behind little more than a collection of strange books and a silver locket that Eliza now wore around her neck.

Yet something about the letter called to her, like a voice from a half-remembered dream. Three days later, she found herself on a train heading north, watching as the landscape transformed from urban sprawl to rolling countryside, and finally to dense, ancient forest.

## Chapter 1: Arrival

The taxi driver refused to take her all the way to the house.

"I don't go past the old stone bridge, miss," he said, his eyes darting nervously to the rearview mirror. "Not since what happened to old Jim Farley when he tried to drive there after dark."

"What happened to him?" Eliza asked.

The driver shook his head. "Some say he never came back. Others say he did, but he wasn't the same after. Either way, I'll take you to the bridge, but no further."

As promised, he left her at a moss-covered stone arch that spanned a narrow, swift-flowing river. On the other side, a path disappeared into the woods. With a deep breath, Eliza shouldered her bag and began to walk.

The forest seemed to close around her, the trees growing taller and more twisted with each step. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and something else—something sweet and slightly cloying, like overripe fruit. Time seemed to stretch and distort; what should have been a twenty-minute walk felt like hours.

Just as Eliza began to wonder if she had somehow missed the manor, the trees parted, revealing a clearing. And there it stood: Fairchild Manor, a sprawling Gothic structure of dark stone and stained glass, its towers and turrets reaching toward a sky that had grown unexpectedly dark with storm clouds.

Standing on the gravel drive, Eliza felt a strange sensation—not quite déjà vu, but something deeper. A sense of recognition, as if the house knew her, had been waiting for her.

The massive oak door swung open before she could knock, revealing a tall, thin woman in a high-necked black dress that might have been fashionable a century ago.

"Miss Winters," the woman said, her voice as dry as autumn leaves. "We've been expecting you. I am Mrs. Graves, the housekeeper. Please, come in. The others have already arrived."

"The others?" Eliza asked, stepping into a grand entrance hall dominated by a sweeping staircase.

"The other heirs, of course," Mrs. Graves replied with the faintest hint of a smile. "You didn't think you were the only one, did you?"

As the door closed behind her with a sound like a sigh, Eliza couldn't shake the feeling that she had just stepped into a story whose ending had already been written—and that it might not be a happy one.

## Chapter 2: The Gathering

The drawing room of Fairchild Manor seemed designed to intimidate. Towering bookshelves lined the walls, interrupted only by portraits of stern-faced men and women whose eyes seemed to follow Eliza as she entered. A fire roared in a fireplace large enough to stand in, casting dancing shadows across the Persian carpet.

Four people turned to look at her, their conversations halting mid-sentence. They formed a tableau that might have been arranged by a theater director: the elderly gentleman by the fireplace, leaning on an ebony cane; the middle-aged woman in the wingback chair, her red hair pulled into a severe bun; the young man by the window, handsome in a brooding way; and the girl perched on the piano bench, who couldn't have been more than sixteen.

"Ah, the final guest arrives," said the elderly man, his voice surprisingly strong. "Now we can begin."

"Begin what, exactly?" Eliza asked, finding her voice. "I'm afraid I'm at a disadvantage. I don't know any of you, or why I'm here."

The red-haired woman laughed, a sound without warmth. "Join the club, dear. We're all strangers here, connected only by whatever twisted game old Edmund decided to play with his fortune."

"Not all strangers," the young man said quietly. "Some of us have met before, haven't we, Victoria?"

The woman—Victoria—stiffened but said nothing.

"Perhaps introductions are in order," the elderly man suggested. "I am Professor Arthur Blackwood, distant cousin to Edmund through his mother's side. This is Victoria Fairchild-Ross, Edmund's niece by his younger brother."

Victoria inclined her head slightly, her green eyes assessing Eliza with unconcealed curiosity.

"By the window is Daniel Thorne, grandson of Edmund's sister Margaret. And the young lady at the piano is Lily Gray, whose connection to the family is... less clear."

The girl at the piano looked up, her pale face framed by dark curls. "My grandmother was a servant here," she said, her voice soft but steady. "But Mr. Fairchild's letter said I had as much right to be here as any of you."

An uncomfortable silence followed, broken by the entrance of Mrs. Graves carrying a silver tray with a decanter and glasses.

"Mr. Blackwood will be joining you shortly," she announced. "He suggests you might wish for refreshment while you wait."

"Blackwood?" Eliza asked. "Like the solicitor who sent the letters?"

"My nephew," Professor Blackwood explained. "Thaddeus handles all the legal matters for the Fairchild estate. Has done for years, just as his father did before him."

As Mrs. Graves poured amber liquid into crystal glasses, Eliza noticed something odd about her movements—a slight stiffness, as if she were a mechanical doll whose joints needed oiling. When the housekeeper handed Eliza her glass, their fingers brushed, and Eliza was startled by how cold the woman's skin felt.

"To new acquaintances," Victoria said, raising her glass in a mock toast. "And to whatever secrets Fairchild Manor has been keeping all these years."

As they drank, thunder rumbled outside, and the lights flickered momentarily. In that brief darkness, Eliza thought she saw something move in the corner of the room—a shadow that didn't belong to any of the people present.

When the lights steadied, the drawing room door opened once more, revealing a man in a perfectly tailored black suit. His face was angular, almost too symmetrical, with eyes so dark they appeared to have no pupils.

"Good evening," he said, his voice like velvet over stone. "I am Thaddeus Blackwood. Thank you all for coming. Now, if you'll follow me to the library, it's time to discuss why Edmund Fairchild has brought you to this house—and what he expects each of you to do to earn your inheritance."

As they filed out of the drawing room, Eliza couldn't help but notice that the portraits on the walls seemed to have shifted slightly, their painted eyes now all focused on the departing group.

And somewhere, deep within the walls of Fairchild Manor, something that had been sleeping for a very long time began to wake.
