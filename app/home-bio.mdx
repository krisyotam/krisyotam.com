**Navigation**: For access to all current pages the command menu in the bottom right will take you there. This site is fairly meticulously designed, for a feed of updated posts just hit the toggle 
in the bottom left to switch back. Every posts is designed to have one category, and numerous tags for subtopics it discusses. For up to date post categories for all posts on the site go [here](/categories), and for tags [here](/tags). 
It is not available yet (4/29/2025), however I am working on my [series page](/series). I page similar to categories, and tags this will just list posts I have grouped under a common theme in a specified order. May be things such as topical studies, 
analysis of a specific persons work, ect.

**Features**: This site built in next.js and currently deployed on vercel. Soon to switch providers to a more long term secure solution. Boasts a ton features. I have taken inspiration from most notably [Gwern Branwen](https://gwern.net/index), [Fabian Schultz](https://www.fabianschultz.com/), and [Guillermo Ruach](https://rauchg.com/). For more of the sites I have taken inspiration from I keep track 
via the [Colophon](/colophon) page. To conver some of the more important immediate features, in the top right there is a settings menu. It has 6 options currently (Search, RSS, FAQ, Changelog, Scripts, Github). Search allows you to search the site for both pages, and posts. RSS simply provided the rss.xml for those who prefer to read via a rss reader. 
FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) is a way for me to answer simple quetions that need a relatively short answer and refer back to them by slug. Changelog is how you keep up with the site, it is tied to my github commits and will auto update based on relevant commit messages. Scripts is for site architecture scripts, what you will find here will be things like 
my URL Archiving script, Prose Linter, Verse Linter, ect. These will not be scripts that are related to a specific posts. Those will be available via either the post themselves or a external repo [here]().

**Navigation**: This site is fairly simple, in the bottom left there is a button which allows you toggle between home page & home feed. Home Feed lists direct access to the most recent posts
which can be found categorized [here](/categories). Home Page where you are currently located lists some basic information on this site. To the bottom right there is a home button,
this is the central navigation for the site. Through it you can access most pages, however some unlinked pages may be documented in my [wiki](/wiki).
