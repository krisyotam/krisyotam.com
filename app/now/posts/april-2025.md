## Core Focus Areas

My primary attention is directed toward three key areas:

- Developing a comprehensive framework for interdisciplinary education
- Writing and publishing my next book on the philosophy of knowledge acquisition
- Building a digital garden to share my interconnected thoughts and research

## Current Projects

## Fitness & Well-being

**How I'm maintaining physical and mental health**:

## What I'm Avoiding

**Deliberately stepping back from**:

- Excessive news consumption and information overload
- Commitments that don't align with my core values and current focus areas
- Reactive work that doesn't contribute to long-term goals
- Environments and relationships that drain rather than energize

## Teaching & Sharing

**How I'm sharing knowledge and contributing**:

- Mentoring three graduate students in interdisciplinary research methods
- Monthly seminar series on classical education in the digital age
- Contributing to open-source educational resources
- Writing a bi-weekly newsletter exploring the intersection of philosophy, education, and technology
