# Laboratory Methods

## Introduction

This document outlines standard laboratory methods and procedures commonly employed across various scientific disciplines. Following these methods ensures consistency, reproducibility, and validity of experimental results.

## General Laboratory Safety

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

- Lab coats: Always wear appropriate lab coats when handling chemicals or biological materials
- Gloves: Nitrile gloves for general purpose, specialized gloves for specific hazards
- Eye protection: Safety glasses, goggles, or face shields depending on the risk level
- Respiratory protection: Masks or respirators when working with hazardous fumes or particles

### Emergency Procedures

- Location and operation of emergency showers and eyewash stations
- Fire safety protocols and evacuation procedures
- Chemical spill containment and cleanup procedures
- First aid kit locations and basic first aid procedures
