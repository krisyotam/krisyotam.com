My reviews are crossposted to my [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/krisyotam/). If you are here from letterboxd, and confused about the format
of my reviews, I give 2 reviews: a critic review, and a viewer review. The critic review is more analytical, while the viewer review is more personal. 
Each have a star rating out of 10, a percentage out of 100, and a short quote. For my methodology view the post [Toward a Theory of Film Critique](/notes/reviews/theory-of-film-critique).
