# Premise 
Set in late 1980s suburban Ohio, "Heathers" follows a smart, and cynical teenager named Veronica Sawyer as she navigates a toxic highschool social 
hierarchy dominated by a clique of popular girls named the Heathers. Veronica initially drawn to the glamarous lifestyle of the Heathers soon runs into 
a rebellious new student, Jason "J.D." Dean, who tears apart her understanding of the world. Together, they embark on a dark comedic adventure of rewriting the 
social order of Westerburg High. However things quickly spriral out of the scope Veronica had intended. This film explores themes of justice, revenge, nihilism and the dark side of adolescence.


# First Impressions 
- touch on dark comedy, satire
- touch on winona, slater 



# Structure & Style 
The film is directed by **Michael Lehmann** first-time feature film director, and written by **Daniel Waters** who is heavily 
influenced by noir, salinger, and classic satire. The film's visual style is characterized by its bold colors, striking compositions, 
and a satirical edge that sets it apart from typical teen comedies of the era.

The film is packed with bright, stylized color palettes-each Heather has a signature color (red, yellow, and green) that reflects their perosnality. 


The Musical Score is a synth-heavy score with eerie, and slightly whimsical cues. It is done by David Newman. 



# Ideas & Themes 
Teen Suicide is the theme most heavily touched on in "Heathers." The 1980s saw a drastic rise in teen suicide rates within the United States. 
Between 1960 and 1988 the suicide rate for youth aged 15-19 more than doubled. Media had started to cover these deaths more prominently, leading to 
public alarm and the rise of "copycat suicides." Giving way to a cultural conversation about the pressures faced by teenagers.
