# Introduction

<Dropcap>F</Dropcap>ew anime have left as profound a mark on the medium and its audience as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Over a quarter-century since its debut, Hideaki Anno's masterpiece continues to provoke discussion, analysis, and emotional response unlike any other series. What begins as a seemingly conventional mecha show gradually transforms into an intense psychological exploration of depression, existential dread, and the fundamental pain of human connection. The series defies expectation at every turn, eschewing genre conventions and narrative satisfaction in favor of raw emotional truth.

In this review, I'll examine what makes Evangelion such an enduring work, from its groundbreaking animation and sound design to its complex characters and philosophical themes. I'll also consider how the series' ending - both the controversial TV finale and the theatrical release of End of Evangelion - continues to challenge and divide viewers decades later.

# Revolutionary Deconstruction

> "I can't find a place for myself in a world like this."  
> ― Shinji Ikari

<Dropcap>E</Dropcap>vangelion arrived at a crucial moment in anime history, when the mecha genre had become formulaic and predictable. Anno deliberately set out to subvert audience expectations, using familiar tropes as a gateway to explore deeper psychological territory. The show's protagonists don't find glory or fulfillment in piloting their mechs; instead, they experience trauma, alienation, and existential crisis. The Evangelion units themselves are revealed to be <Spoiler>biological entities rather than traditional robots, containing the souls of the pilots' mothers</Spoiler>, transforming the standard "boy meets robot" narrative into something far more unsettling.

What's particularly striking is how the series gradually shifts its visual and narrative approach as it progresses. Early episodes maintain a relatively conventional aesthetic and pacing, but by the series' conclusion, we're witnessing fragmented narratives, experimental animation techniques, and the complete breakdown of the fourth wall. This mirrors the psychological disintegration of the characters themselves, creating a viewing experience that is as disorienting as it is captivating.

# Psychological Depth & Character Development

<Dropcap>A</Dropcap>t the heart of Evangelion is a cast of deeply wounded characters, each struggling with profound psychological trauma. Shinji Ikari, our reluctant protagonist, embodies passive depression, seeking validation from a father who sees him only as a tool. Asuka Langley Soryu masks her insecurity and abandonment issues with aggression and pride. Rei Ayanami, seemingly emotionless, gradually discovers her humanity despite her <Spoiler>nature as a partial clone of Shinji's mother</Spoiler>.

What elevates these characters beyond typical anime archetypes is Anno's unflinching portrayal of their mental illness. There are no easy cures or cathartic breakthroughs - their conditions fluctuate, worsen under stress, and require constant management. The series gives us unprecedented access to their inner thoughts, particularly in later episodes where extended internal monologues and surreal imagery convey emotional states that dialogue alone cannot express.

The show's adult characters fare no better. Misato Katsuragi drowns her trauma in alcohol and casual sex. Dr. Ritsuko Akagi repeats her mother's self-destructive patterns. And Gendo Ikari, perhaps the most damaged of all, has twisted his grief into a monstrous plan to <Spoiler>reunite with his dead wife by triggering an apocalyptic event</Spoiler>.

# Visual & Audio Excellence

<Dropcap>E</Dropcap>vangelion's visual identity is unmistakable. From the iconic designs of the EVA units to the clinical sterility of NERV headquarters, every element serves both aesthetic and thematic purposes. The series pioneered numerous animation techniques, including its distinctive use of timing and stillness - moments of quiet punctuated by explosive action, often accompanied by classical music that creates jarring yet effective emotional contrasts.

Particularly striking is the series' use of Christian symbolism and imagery, from the cruciform explosions of the Angels to the Kabbalistic diagrams that appear during operations. While Anno has famously stated that much of this imagery was chosen primarily for its exotic visual impact on Japanese audiences, it nonetheless contributes to the show's unique aesthetic and philosophical weight.

The sound design deserves special mention, particularly Shiro Sagisu's eclectic score, which ranges from orchestral pieces like "Decisive Battle" to jazz-influenced tracks and the incongruously upbeat "A Cruel Angel's Thesis" opening theme. The contrast between these musical styles heightens the emotional impact of key scenes, while voice performances (particularly Megumi Ogata as Shinji) convey psychological nuance that elevates the material further.

# Controversial Ending & Legacy

<Dropcap>N</Dropcap>o discussion of Evangelion is complete without addressing its notorious conclusion. The final two episodes abandoned conventional narrative entirely, taking place almost entirely within Shinji's mind during <Spoiler>Instrumentality, the forced evolution of humanity into a single consciousness</Spoiler>. Rendered in minimalist, experimental animation due partly to budget constraints, these episodes provide a psychological resolution while leaving the external narrative largely unresolved.

The backlash was immediate and intense, leading to death threats against Anno and eventually resulting in the theatrical release of End of Evangelion, which depicts the external events occurring during Instrumentality. Yet this film, with its apocalyptic imagery and ambiguous conclusion, proved no less divisive. The dual endings represent two sides of the same thematic coin - one internal and one external - and continue to inspire debate and analysis decades later.

Evangelion's impact extends far beyond anime. It revitalized the entire medium commercially and creatively, inspiring countless imitators and responses. Its psychological approach to characterization raised the bar for depth in animated storytelling, while its merchandising success created the template for modern anime business models. The recent Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy has introduced the series to new generations, while also providing Anno himself an opportunity to revisit and potentially reframe his most famous work.

# Favorite Characters

<Dropcap>E</Dropcap>vangelion's cast is remarkably complex, with even tertiary characters receiving meaningful development. For this review, I'll focus on the four who left the strongest impression: Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryu, Misato Katsuragi, and Kaworu Nagisa.

### Shinji Ikari

> "I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away... I mustn't run away..."  
> ― Shinji Ikari

<Dropcap>S</Dropcap>hinji is perhaps the most divisive protagonist in anime history - a reluctant hero who often fails to display traditional heroic qualities. His passivity and emotional fragility frustrate viewers accustomed to more assertive protagonists, yet these very qualities make him one of anime's most realistic depictions of adolescent depression and trauma response. Abandoned by his father after his mother's death, Shinji has built his identity around avoiding rejection by never forming deep attachments.

What makes Shinji compelling isn't heroism but his painful authenticity. His struggle isn't against Angels but against his own self-loathing and fear of connection. When he does take action, it stems from complex, often unhealthy motivations - piloting EVA-01 not from courage but from desperate need for approval, protecting his friends not from altruism but fear of losing what little connection he has. This psychological realism makes his occasional moments of growth all the more powerful, even as the series denies him (and us) a simple transformative arc.

### Asuka Langley Soryu

<Dropcap>A</Dropcap>suka presents as Shinji's opposite - confident, aggressive, and fiercely independent. Yet this exterior masks equally profound trauma. Having lost her mother to suicide after being replaced in her affections by a doll (following a devastating mental breakdown), Asuka has built her entire identity around achievement and self-sufficiency. Her EVA piloting skills aren't just professional accomplishments but the core of her self-worth.

What makes Asuka fascinating is watching this facade gradually crumble as the series progresses. Her declining synchronization rates with EVA-02 trigger an identity crisis that culminates in a devastating mental breakdown. The sequence where we witness <Spoiler>Asuka catatonic in a bathtub after being psychologically invaded by the 15th Angel</Spoiler> ranks among the most disturbing portrayals of mental collapse in animation. Yet even at her lowest, Asuka retains a fierce determination that makes her final moments in End of Evangelion - <Spoiler>fighting to the last despite overwhelming odds</Spoiler> - one of the film's most powerful sequences.

### Misato Katsuragi

<Dropcap>M</Dropcap>isato occupies a complex position as both authority figure and deeply flawed adult. Survivor of the Second Impact that killed her father, she carries survivor's guilt alongside a conflicted desire for both revenge against the Angels and reconnection with her distant father. Her professional competence contrasts sharply with her chaotic personal life, where she uses physical relationships (particularly with Kaji) to avoid emotional intimacy.

What makes Misato particularly interesting is her relationship with Shinji, which oscillates uncomfortably between surrogate mother, commanding officer, and something more ambiguous. She recognizes aspects of her own trauma in him, yet lacks the emotional tools to help him healthily. Their parallel journeys - both seeking connection while fearing vulnerability - culminate in End of Evangelion's controversial <Spoiler>kiss scene before her death</Spoiler>, a moment that encapsulates the series' exploration of how damaged people struggle to express genuine connection.

### Kaworu Nagisa

<Dropcap>D</Dropcap>espite appearing in only one episode of the original series, Kaworu makes an indelible impression as someone who offers Shinji something he desperately needs: unconditional acceptance. As the <Spoiler>final Angel in human form</Spoiler>, Kaworu represents both ultimate threat and ultimate possibility for connection. His declaration that Shinji is "worthy of love" directly contradicts the core of Shinji's self-loathing, making their brief relationship one of the series' most significant.

The tragic necessity of <Spoiler>Shinji having to kill Kaworu</Spoiler> forms one of Evangelion's most devastating moments, made more powerful by the serene acceptance with which Kaworu meets his fate. His brief appearance raises profound questions about the nature of humanity and connection, themes that the series continues to explore through its conclusion. Few characters have achieved such narrative and thematic significance with so little screen time.

# Conclusion

<Dropcap>N</Dropcap>eon Genesis Evangelion remains a watershed moment in anime history, a work whose influence extends far beyond its medium.

It demands engagement on multiple levels, rewarding repeated viewings with new insights and interpretations.

More than 25 years after its original broadcast, new viewers continue to discover Evangelion and find themselves transformed by its uncomfortable truths and profound questions.
