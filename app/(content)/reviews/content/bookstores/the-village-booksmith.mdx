# Location 
The Village Booksmith is located at 526 Oak Street, neatly nestled on the east side of Baraboo's courthouse square, 
next to Third and Fourth Streets. It's next to a Corner Drug Store, and faces a historic monument. 
A canon. 
  
The area is quite small, and cozy. Gives off a "Stars Hollow" feel. The square itself is part of the 
Downtown Baraboo Historic District, which features 19th- and early 20th-century commercial architecture—Italianate, Romanesque Revival, Neoclassical, and more—all framed around 
the iconic Sauk County Courthouse.
  

# Book Collection

### Literary Fiction

### Essays 
The essays section was quite under the radar. My first visit I almost walked out of the store without
noticing it. There were however quite a view gems. Such as a first edition set of "The Essays of Montaigne" 
by Michel De Montaigne. 

### Poetry 
The poetry section in itself was around 2 decently sized shelfs tall. It had a decent collection of 
american poetry 16-18th century. I had managed to find myself two first edition copies. One of 
"Oxford Book of English Verse", and one of "Oxford 18th Century English Verse"

# Staff & Service 
The Bookstore is quite small, and I assume run by the young woman I presume to be the Owner of the 
bookstore. She was quite helpful, and glad to show me to the reference section in hopes of finding a 
Oxford Compact Dictionary to make use of while on retreat. She also unlike several other employees who 
I don't necessarily blame for this. Decided to stay and search for a copy rather then pointing to the shelf 
and walking away. Even though she was unseccseful in finding one, I did manage to get my hands on a 
Webster's New World Dictionary which was ok for the time being. All together my experience there was 
quite pleasant, and I have no complaints about the service in the slightest.
