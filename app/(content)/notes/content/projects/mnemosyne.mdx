# Prelude
I have dealt with high levels of stress, and anxiety for the mass majority of my life. Since highscool [post-pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) I have 
only watched these negative aspects of myself increase, and additional problems add on. I gained over 30 pounds in the 3 years between 
december of 2021, and september of 2025. My eating habits became even more attrocious. I had no schedule, my mental fog increased. I saw a large 
increase in irritability. A impossible to maintain sleep schedule, paranoia, and a multitude of other issues physically, mentally, and emotionally. 

# Background of Project M 
Back in June of 2025 I had started brainstorming some solutions to this. Becoming a nomad, heavily decreasing my technology usage, permenantly relocating 
to a place where I can live a slower life. My mind was moving a mile a minute and the only thing I wanted was peace. The more time went on the less, and less 
I was willing to negotiate for sacrificing it, and the more pugnacious I became about the conversations I had, thing's I watched, and people I 
spent my time with. All though there are only so many parameters you can afford to add as a unemployed 20 year old sending out dozens of appllications a day without the 
mental energy to create anything. Knowing your life will remain stagnant as a ai system keeps filtering you out of the pool for entry level jobs for lacking the 5 years of 
experience required to put books on shelves. I feel this mundane period of my life is quite well summed up by a [haiku](/verse/haiku/tachyon) I wrote a while back.
 After finally becoming employed in august I decided it was time to get serious. The poor haven't time to dilly dally. 
I was looking through a lot of my old notes as I was transferring them, and one specific one stuck out to me. **Project M** a project where I detailed a list of personal metrics 
that I could begin to track in hopes of analyzing them down the line to gain insights I otherwise would not have known. 

# Wisdom & Big Sister
For those of you unaware. For the past year I have been planning a project that I just have not got along to implementing. A completely private LLM Assistant 
that had abilities to communicate with me through platforms like discord, and telegram. Notify me of things, and manage several scripted workflows. Her name
is "Wisdom". Her name coming from <Bible>Proverbs 7:4-23</Bible> "Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister". The idea is a system that would be put in place to alert me of causes, and correlations in data 
as a sort of corrective, and preventative measure of sorts. Leading me into one of the largest features of Wisdom I spent quite some time thinking about. A feature I call 
**Big Sister**, a lifelogging system that gives wisdom offline access to a searchable well indexed system of my personal data. One of the major problems with this system 
is of course that LLMs do not yet have nearly a long enough context window for perfoming such analysis raw, and gaining continuous insights solo from the data as it is updated. However a lot 
of these issues can be avoided through clever scripting, and notation.
