<Collapse title="About Research Bounties">
Sometimes in research, despite my best search techniques, I am unable to get a digital copy of a paper or book to upload to Libgen. This page lists my failures to date, and offers bounties for anyone who can get me a digital copy of them (often possible via a university ILL department, which are no longer accessible to me).
Internet Archive scans are not accepted due to low quality, unless there are extenuating circumstances.
Standard bounties: $10 for papers/theses/chapters & $20 for books/videos/miscellaneous
Payment methods: PayPal or Amazon gift cards preferred; other methods possible but may require more work
Additional costs: I may pay bounty+costs if not unreasonable or you contact me in advance with the total
To claim: Contact me with the copy. Payments are first-come-first served unless you contact me in advance so I can remove it from the list & avoid unnecessary duplication.
