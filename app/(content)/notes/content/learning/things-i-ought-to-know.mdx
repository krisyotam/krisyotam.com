<Box>For a lot of things I do a very wide knowledge base is generally useful in multiple ways. 
Especially the type of knowledge known as Declarative Knowledge.</Box>

<Collapse title="What is Declarative Knowledge?"> the type of knowledge that involves facts and information you can consciously recall and 
stateâ€”"knowing that" something is true. It includes things like names, dates, definitions, and concepts, such as "The Earth orbits the Sun."</Collapse>

# On Anki 
As I am sure many of you know, Anki is a flashcard app that uses spaced repetition to help you learn and retain infromation. I use it to help me remember 
specific facts, concepts, and information that I find useful. If you are interested in copying my decks, you can also find them on my [Anki Profile](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1234567890).
However I will list them all here for easy access. I would reccomend going through a breif tutorial on how to use Anki before you start using these decks. It can get very overwhelming, very quickly.
