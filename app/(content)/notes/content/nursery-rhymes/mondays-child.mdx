Monday's child is fair of face  
Tuesday's child is full of grace  
Wednesday's child is full of woe  
Thursday's child has far to go  
Friday's child is loving and giving  
Saturday's child works hard for a living  
And the child that is born on the Sabbath day  
Is bonny and blithe, and good and gay.
