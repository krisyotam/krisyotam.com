# Introduction 
This is a curriculum designed for those who are interested in pursuing a advanced understanding of pure mathematics, particularly one based on the 
Cambride Mathematical Tripos. It is designed as a accelerated learning path, allowing you to cover the material in a much shorter time frame than tradtional methods. 
If done right it is intended to be a full replacement for a university degree in pure mathematics as far as the core material is concerned. 

## Core Philosophy 

## Prerequisites 


### Core Pure Mathematics 
- **Proof Writing**: Understanding and constructing mathematical proofs (direct proof, proof by contradiction, proof by induction).
- **Algebra**: Polynomials, algebraic division, factor theorem, inequalities, functions (domain, range, inverse, composite), graph sketching.
- **Coordinate Geometry**: Equations of lines and circles, parametric equations.
- **Sequences and Series**: Arithmetic and geometric series, binomial expansion.
- **Trigonometry**: Identities, equations, inverse trigonometric functions, sum and product formulae.
- **Exponentials and Logarithms**: Properties and graphs.
- **Calculus**: Differentiation (from first principles, rules for differentiation, applications to gradients, tangents, normals, stationary points), Integration (as a limit of a sum, fundamental theorem, techniques of integration, applications to areas and volumes).
- **Numerical Methods**: Iteration, locating roots.


### Further Pure Mathematics 
- **Complex Numbers**: 
- **Matrices**: 
- **Further Algebra & Functions**: 
- **Further Calculus**: 
- **Vectors**: 
- **Hyperbolic Functions**: 
- **Differential Equations**: 
- **Polar Coordinates**:
