<Box>I am sure there is a lower bound to minimalism. I am equally sure that I have not found it. So here I present a 
reverse chronological list of steps I have taken, and continue to take over the years.</Box>

<Box>This year my actions are quite a lot more intentional when it comes to the aspects of 
minimalism, intentional & slow living.</Box>

- I have started to declutter my time by removing all social media from my phone. 
    - using a android phone with a minimalist launcher 
    - putting phone in greyscale mode 
    - not active on any social media platforms (still have accounts reserved for future use)

- Got rid of a host of clothing simplifying my wardribe to the following:
    - 5 pairs of jeans
    - 2 pairs of sweat pants 
    - essentials such as socks, and underwear 
    - White, and Black t-shirts (have not limited the number of these yet)
    - 2 pairs of shoes (black, and beige)

<Box>This is the first year you can say I was formally introduced to minimalism. Most of the things done here were 
along the lines of "meditations", and less action.</Box>
