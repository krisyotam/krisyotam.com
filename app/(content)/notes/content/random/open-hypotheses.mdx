# Open Hypotheses

Testable ideas about how the world works that I find plausible but haven't seen rigorously tested. Some are personal theories, others are hunches that could benefit from systematic investigation.

## Human Behavior

- **The Curiosity Plateau**: People's willingness to learn new things peaks in their late twenties and then gradually declines, independent of cognitive ability
- **Complexity Preference Inversion**: As people become experts in a field, they increasingly prefer simple solutions, while novices are attracted to complex ones
- **Social Proof Delay**: The influence of social proof on behavior has a lag time that varies predictably based on the domain and individual traits

## Technology & Society

- **The Interface Sophistication Cycle**: User interfaces alternate between periods of increasing complexity (adding features) and simplification (removing them) in roughly 7-year cycles
- **Digital Tool Abandonment Pattern**: People stop using digital tools not when they find better alternatives, but when the tools become "too helpful" and reduce their sense of agency
- **Remote Work Equilibrium**: Fully remote teams naturally settle into communication patterns that mirror the timezone distribution of their members

## Learning & Creativity

- **The Explanation Test**: The best way to determine if you understand something is to try explaining it to someone who knows nothing about the topic
- **Creative Constraint Optimization**: There's an optimal level of constraint that maximizes creative outputâ€”too few constraints lead to paralysis, too many lead to mechanical execution
- **Knowledge Half-Life Variation**: Different types of knowledge decay at predictable rates based on how abstract they are

## Economic Behavior

- **The Overhead Paradox**: Organizations naturally develop overhead that exactly consumes any efficiency gains from new tools or processes
- **Value Perception Lag**: People consistently undervalue things they get for free and overvalue things they pay for, even when controlling for actual utility
- **Decision Fatigue Threshold**: The quality of decisions degrades predictably after making approximately 35-40 decisions in a day

## Personal Development

- **Skill Transfer Asymmetry**: Skills transfer from technical domains to creative domains more easily than the reverse
- **Habit Formation Interference**: Trying to establish more than 2-3 new habits simultaneously reduces the success rate of all of them
- **Identity Lag Theory**: People's self-concept updates about 6-18 months behind their actual behavior changes

*Each hypothesis could become a research project. Some might be wrong, but wrong in interesting ways.*
