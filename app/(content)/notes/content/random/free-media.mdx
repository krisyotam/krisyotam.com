# On Paid Media 
Our world is becoming increasingly dominated by paid media, where content is often locked behind paywalls or subscription models. Some of these things there may be little 
alternative to, but there are many things that can be done to access most media for free. I reccommend you stay away from paid media as much as possible with it's increasingly 
high subscription costs, and data harvesting practices. Your money is better spent on things that matter, like your health, eduction, and hobbies (the one's you cant participate in for free). 
As far as ethics go these corporations are not ethical, and they are not your friends. They are in it for the money, and they will do anything to get it. They will exploit you, your data, and your time without a second thought. 
So why wouldn't you willingly exploit every Loophole you can to get the same media for free? 

# On Tracking Media 
One of the biggest issues with free media is often that it is consumed through a number of different platforms, none of which you want to sign up for. Which 
leads to a tricky issue. How do you keep track of what you have watched, read, or listened to? This is where a good media tracker comes in.
