<Box>As should be clear of "Hobbies" the goal or intention of this post is not to give you cheeky ways to money with various affiliate marketing 
methods. The goal of this is simply to provide a list of "activities that can be done regularly in one's leisure time for pleasure."</Box>

<Collapse title="How was this list compiled?">I have long been interested what hobbies people all over the world do. A post adjacent to this one is [Children's Games](), you could say my interest for both of these topics
was greatly enhanced by Squid Game from "Squid Game", and from youtuber [Lanchen's](https://www.youtube.com/@justlanchen) interesting hobby/activities videos. </Collapse>

At the moment I am fairly unsure how I will organize this list, but I do know that I want to include a wide variety of hobbies so we will see how this goes. 

Note* some of these hobbies are not "hobbies" in the traditional sense, but rather activities that can be done in one's leisure time for pleasure.
also note that not all of these hobbies are "inexpensive", "free", or "accessible" to all audiences. Some of these hobbies are quite expensive get over it.
