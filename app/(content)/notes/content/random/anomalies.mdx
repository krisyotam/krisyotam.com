# Anomalies

Things that don't fit the expected patterns. Observations that make me pause and question my models of how the world works.

## Behavioral Anomalies

- **The Productivity Paradox**: People who work fewer hours often produce more valuable output than those who work longer hours
- **The Expertise Blind Spot**: Experts in a field are often the worst at explaining it to beginners
- **Social Media Depression**: Platforms designed to connect people often make them feel more isolated
- **The Help Aversion Puzzle**: Many people would rather struggle alone than ask for assistance, even when help is freely available

## Economic Anomalies

- **The Paradox of Choice in Markets**: More competition sometimes leads to worse outcomes for consumers
- **Free Product Premium**: People often value paid versions of products more highly than identical free versions
- **The Wealth Happiness Plateau**: Beyond a certain point, additional income has diminishing returns on happiness, yet people continue pursuing it aggressively
- **Open Source Success**: Some of the most valuable software is built by volunteers who aren't paid

## Technological Anomalies

- **The Simplicity-Complexity Cycle**: Technologies tend to start simple, become complex, then simple again
- **Feature Addition Obsession**: Software companies keep adding features even when users consistently ask for simplicity
- **The Documentation Neglect Pattern**: The most important code is often the least documented
- **Backwards Compatibility Burden**: Systems become harder to improve as they become more successful

## Learning Anomalies

- **The Forgetting Curve Acceleration**: We forget things faster in the age of external memory (search engines, phones)
- **Tutorial Hell**: People can spend years learning without ever building anything
- **The Knowledge Curse**: The more you know about a subject, the harder it becomes to imagine not knowing it
- **Skill Transfer Asymmetry**: Some skills transfer between domains, others don't, in unpredictable ways

## Social Anomalies

- **The Loneliness Epidemic**: People are more connected than ever but report feeling more alone
- **Opinion Polarization**: Access to more information sometimes makes people less informed
- **The Bystander Effect**: Individuals are less likely to help when more people are present
- **Status Game Inversion**: In some communities, signaling low status becomes a form of high status

## Creative Anomalies

- **The Blank Page Problem**: Infinite possibilities can be paralyzing rather than liberating
- **Constraint-Creativity Correlation**: Limitations often enhance rather than hinder creative output
- **The 80/20 Rule in Art**: Most of the value comes from a small fraction of the work
- **Inspiration Timing**: Creative insights often come when we're not actively trying to be creative

## Organizational Anomalies

- **Parkinson's Law**: Work expands to fill the time available for its completion
- **The Peter Principle**: People get promoted to their level of incompetence
- **Meeting Multiplication**: The more people in a meeting, the less gets decided
- **Committee Conservatism**: Groups often make safer decisions than individuals would

*Each anomaly suggests our intuitive models of the world are incomplete. They're features, not bugs, in the complexity of human systems.*
