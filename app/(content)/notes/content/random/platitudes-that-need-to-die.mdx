# Platitudes That Need to Die

Common wisdom that sounds profound but often leads people astray. These phrases persist because they're comfortable lies that let us avoid harder truths.

## "Everything happens for a reason"

**Why it's harmful**: This suggests that suffering serves some cosmic purpose, which diminishes the real pain people experience and discourages action to prevent future suffering.

**Better truth**: Most things happen randomly. We create meaning by choosing how to respond to what happens to us.

## "Follow your passion"

**Why it's harmful**: Passion often follows mastery, not the other way around. This advice ignores the reality that most valuable work requires developing skills that aren't initially exciting.

**Better truth**: Develop valuable skills, find ways to contribute meaningfully, and passion often emerges from competence.

## "Money can't buy happiness"

**Why it's harmful**: This is usually said by people who have enough money. Financial stress is real, and basic security does improve well-being significantly.

**Better truth**: Money can't buy happiness beyond a certain point, but poverty definitely creates suffering.

## "Just be yourself"

**Why it's harmful**: Sometimes "yourself" is anxious, unprepared, or inconsiderate. Personal growth often requires being better than your current self.

**Better truth**: Be the best version of yourself, and work to expand what that means.

## "Work hard and you'll succeed"

**Why it's harmful**: This ignores luck, privilege, systemic barriers, and the fact that many people work extremely hard without achieving conventional success.

**Better truth**: Work smart on valuable things, acknowledge the role of luck, and define success for yourself.

## "If you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best"

**Why it's harmful**: This encourages people to accept bad behavior as authentic rather than working to be better partners, friends, or colleagues.

**Better truth**: Good relationships require effort from both people to minimize their worst tendencies and amplify their best ones.

## "Age is just a number"

**Why it's harmful**: Age brings real changes in energy, health, responsibilities, and perspectives. Pretending otherwise prevents realistic planning and acceptance.

**Better truth**: Age affects many things, but it doesn't determine your worth or potential for growth.

## "There are no stupid questions"

**Why it's harmful**: Some questions are asked without any effort to find the answer first, or reveal a lack of basic preparation that wastes everyone's time.

**Better truth**: Questions that show you've done your homework are welcome. Questions that show you haven't are often stupid.

## "You can be anything you want to be"

**Why it's harmful**: This ignores real constraints like genetics, circumstances, resources, and timing. It sets people up for disappointment and self-blame.

**Better truth**: You have more potential than you probably realize, but real constraints exist. Work within them intelligently.

## "Live each day as if it's your last"

**Why it's harmful**: If you actually did this, you'd make terrible long-term decisions. You'd never save money, exercise, or maintain relationships.

**Better truth**: Balance present enjoyment with future planning. Most days aren't your last.

## "Good things come to those who wait"

**Why it's harmful**: Passivity is rarely rewarded. Good things usually come to those who work toward them while waiting.

**Better truth**: Good things come to those who prepare, persist, and position themselves for opportunities.

## "It's not about the destination, it's about the journey"

**Why it's harmful**: Sometimes the destination matters a lot. If you're walking to the hospital, the journey isn't the point.

**Better truth**: Both journey and destination can matter. Choose your destinations wisely and try to enjoy the path.

## "Failure is not an option"

**Why it's harmful**: This prevents experimentation and learning. Fear of failure often leads to playing it safe and missing opportunities.

**Better truth**: Failure is often the best teacher. Make failure cheap and recover quickly.

## "Think positive"

**Why it's harmful**: Toxic positivity prevents people from processing negative emotions, addressing real problems, or preparing for likely challenges.

**Better truth**: Acknowledge reality honestly, then choose your response wisely.

## "Trust your gut"

**Why it's harmful**: Your gut is full of biases, fears, and incomplete information. It's often wrong about complex decisions.

**Better truth**: Use intuition as one input among many, but verify with evidence and logic.

## "You only live once (YOLO)"

**Why it's harmful**: This is often used to justify short-term thinking and risky behavior that creates long-term problems.

**Better truth**: You only live once, so make it count by thinking long-term and building something meaningful.

## "Time heals all wounds"

**Why it's harmful**: Some wounds require active treatment, not just waiting. Time can also make untreated problems worse.

**Better truth**: Time creates distance from pain, but healing often requires deliberate effort and sometimes professional help.

*These platitudes persist because they're comforting and simple. But comfort and simplicity aren't always what we need. Sometimes we need harder truths that lead to better decisions.*
