# Startup Ideas

Business concepts that solve real problems but haven't been executed well (or at all). Some are too early, others might be waiting for the right team or market conditions.

## Productivity & Tools

- **Context-aware documentation**: Tools that automatically update documentation based on code changes and user behavior
- **Async-first meeting scheduler**: Calendar software designed around asynchronous work rather than real-time meetings
- **Personal API marketplace**: A platform where individuals can monetize their skills through standardized APIs

## Health & Wellness

- **Precision sleep optimization**: Personalized sleep coaching based on genetic, environmental, and behavioral data
- **Mental health for developers**: Specialized therapy and support systems for tech workers
- **Micronutrient tracking**: Simple, accurate ways to track and optimize micronutrient intake

## Education & Learning

- **Skill dependency mapping**: Visual tools that show the prerequisite relationships between different skills
- **Peer learning marketplaces**: Platforms that match people wanting to learn with those wanting to teach
- **Real-world project education**: Structured programs that teach through meaningful work rather than artificial exercises

## Infrastructure & Climate

- **Carbon-negative concrete**: Scalable concrete alternatives that actively remove COâ‚‚ from the atmosphere
- **Hyperlocal weather prediction**: Weather forecasting at the block level using IoT sensors
- **Community energy storage**: Neighborhood-scale battery systems with smart sharing algorithms

*Each idea represents a potential solution to problems I've personally encountered or observed.*
