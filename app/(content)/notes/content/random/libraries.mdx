# On Libraries
There are aprox. 120,000 public libraries in the United States. Public Library Outlets outnumber McDonalds by about 3 to 1. Pre-pandemic, libraries 
in the U.S. received more than **1.25 billion visits** annually in 2019. That dropped to **671 million** in 2022, a roughly 46% decline in visits. 
In 2012, public libraries circulated over **2.3 billion** items, including books, DVDs, and audiobooks. By 2022, that number had dropped to **1.4 billion**, a 39% decline.
One of the most important resources to communities are going underutilized, and that is a great shame. 
This post is a guide for the person who wants to get the mostt out of their local library. I will try my best for comprehensive coverage of libraries, their resources, and how 
to access them.
