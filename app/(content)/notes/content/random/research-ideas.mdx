# Research Ideas

A collection of research directions that seem promising but underexplored. Some are half-formed thoughts, others are more developed hypotheses waiting for the right moment or collaborator.

## Cognitive Science

- The relationship between working memory capacity and creative output
- How linguistic structure influences mathematical reasoning across cultures
- The role of embodiment in abstract thinking

## Technology & Society

- Decentralized reputation systems that resist gaming
- The long-term psychological effects of always-on connectivity
- Designing AI systems that enhance rather than replace human creativity

## Behavioral Economics

- Why do people consistently underestimate compound effects?
- The psychology of risk assessment in unprecedented situations
- How social proof mechanisms can be designed to promote beneficial behaviors

## Meta-Research

- What makes some research paradigms more productive than others?
- How do funding structures influence the types of questions that get asked?
- The role of interdisciplinary collaboration in breakthrough discoveries

*Each idea here represents hours of thinking but years of potential work.*
