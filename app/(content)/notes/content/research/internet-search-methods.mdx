As a avid internet researcher I spend a considerable amount of time searching for information online, and as much as I love the chase of digging through
old archives, blogs, forums, ect. for information. It can also be a frustrating, and quite inefficient process. There are several solutions to this problem. 
Various research focused bloggers have documented their methods. Some of these sites are no longer active (I'll attempt to archive them from mirrors), and some may still
be around in a archaic form. I have split this into posts, "Internet Search Methods", and "Modern Search Methods". The latter is to deal with modern ai search methods, 
and techniques for extracting information.
