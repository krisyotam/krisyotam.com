<Notice type="info">
Despite being labled as a character analysis, posts of the form "Character Analysis of [Character Name]" are more like personally crafted wiki pages 
followed by source anthologies of quotes, scenes, character moments, interviews, and other media related to the character. More of a Obsessive Anthology 
with Analytical Commentary in Chronological Order.
