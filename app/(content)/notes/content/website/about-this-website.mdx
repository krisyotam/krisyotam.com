<Quote author="Nicolás Gómez Dávila">The writer who does not draw up a plan for his work as if he were going to build a cathedral, and who does not execute it stone by stone with the same care with which the medieval master placed his stones under God's eye, 
is not a writer but a dilettante; a scribbler, or worse still, a journalist.</Quote>

# Rating System 

## Status
The status indicator reflects the current state of the work:  
  
- Abandoned: Work that has been discontinued  
- Notes: Initial collections of thoughts and references  
- Draft: Early structured version with a central thesis  
- In Progress: Well-developed work actively being refined  
- Finished: Completed work with no planned major changes  
  
This helps readers understand the maturity and completeness of the content.  

## Certainty 
The confidence tag expresses how well-supported the essay is, or how likely its overall ideas are right. This uses a scale 
from "impossible" to "certain", based on the Kesselman List of Estimative Words:
  
1. "certain"  
2. "highly likely"  
3. "likely"  
4. "possible"  
5. "unlikely"  
6. "highly unlikely"  
7. "remote"  
8. "impossible"  
  
Even ideas that seem unlikely may be worth exploring if their potential impact is significant enough.

## Importance
The importance rating distinguishes between trivial topics and those which might change your life. Using a scale from 0-10, 
content is ranked based on its potential impact on:  
  
- the reader  
- the intended audience  
- the world at large  
  
For example, topics about fundamental research or transformative technologies would rank 9-10, while personal reflections or 
minor experiments might rank 0-1.

# On The Content 

## Target Audience 
<Quote author="Haruki Murakami">I'm not writing for people. I write to clear something out of myself.</Quote>
I agree deeply with this sentiment. The reason I started this site is inherantly selfish. I wanted a place for my thoughts to live independant of myself. 
A place to be seen. I do not expect anyone to read this, care about it, and the least to enjoy it. I simply write what I want to read. However irregardless of this 
philosophy I am aware that their is a lot of useful content on this site, and a lot of people like msyelf that I believe will make use of it. So if i had to 
nail down the "Target Audience" of this site it would the following: The Intellectually Curious, The Creatively Innclined, The enjoyers of Literature, 
Mathematics, Sciences, Film, and Culture. 

## Long Content
<Excerpt title="About This Website" author="Gwern Branwen">
Long Content = material that improves or becomes more interesting as time passes, particularly through mechanisms like embedded predictions that can be validated or falsified.
</Excerpt>
As said above by Gwern, Long Content is material that improves as time passes. Naturally to the curious reader this is taken care of by itslef. As most things carry their own 
historical value. Malware such as ily.vbs may not be useful to the average person, but to the curious reader seeing it's source in context with the os it was meant to target, getting 
into the mindset of the author(s), and the time period it was created in can have great benefits. I myself live for these things. To find the obscure, and overlooked things. To 
dissect them and find the meaning in them. Then to breath new life into them. My goal then is to make this process of reverse engineering content, and finding it's value 
as easy as possible for the future reader. Which is where heavy thought comes into play on systems of archiving, preservation and link management come into play.

</Collapse>

### Where It Came From 
I learned about the idea of Long Now from Gwern Branwen, and continued by looking into the Long Now Foundation. 
Now this form of thinking has become a core part of my self, and as a result this site. I make it a habit to make decisions with the Long term 
in mind, and to think about the future of my work. I want to create content that will not only last, but thrive while being useful for a long 
time.

### What It Is
So what exactly is Long Now though? The best way to explain this is with the "Clock of the Long Now". This is a giant timepiece being built in 
Van Horn, Texas. The goal is to design a clock that will last for 10,000 years. In order to accomplish this the designers have many things to think about. 
What type of materials are durable enough to last, and easy to repair? What materials are valueless to the point that they will not be stolen? What power sources 
are renewable, and unlootable? Likewise when running a internet for the long-term thoughts must be given to the domain, hosting provider(s), 
language(s), framework(s), dependnacies(s) or lack there of.  

Another thing to pay attention to when writing long-form highly cited content like [papers](). Is the 
preservation to sources that are often linked to. You will find dozens of [scripts](), and [prompts]()
which are related to these purposes here. 
<Quote author="Shane Kuhn">Everything is so fleeting and impermanent. It’s enough to drive you bat shit crazy.</Quote>
A good parraell for this is the long now society's [Rosetta Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Project). 
This is a project designed to preserve the languages that have a high likelihood of extinction from 2000-2100. 
Similarly special attention should be given to references from blogs, obscure websites, or custom built websites 
on domains that could go down if they have inactive authors. As opposed to something like wikipedia which is more likely 
to be around even when you are not. 

### Why It Matters


## Finding My Ideas 
I've never really had trouble finding ideas to write about. I have a lot of interests, and I am always thinking about something. The process usually goes something like this 
- Random Tidbit, Poem, Script, ect. --> Note
- Emotionally Conflicted, or Inspired --> Poem 
- Interesting Ideas, Analysis of Loved Works --> Blog Post
- Meditating on In Depth Topics --> Essay
- A highly specific question that I want a in-depth answer to --> Paper
- Fiction is self explanatory 

With that said I do tend to consume a lot of content, and with the collected quotes, references, themes, and ideas I come across. I often run them 
through this [prompt]() in a LLM. Tends to output quite a few interesting suggestions for a piece of writing. The rest are usually just tossed. 

## Information Workflow
<Box>One of the most important aspects of writing is the process of gathering information, and producing quality ideas.
Quality output is a result of thoughtful curation of quality inputs.</Box>
I consume a wide range of content. Academic Papers, Essays, Books, Articles, Blog Posts, Videos, Podcasts, and others Notes. I take these in at various 
levels of seriousness, and with varying levels of intent. Regardless of the medium however, I have been suprised enough by references, unknown facts, quotes, ect. 
in content I am consuming that I now make it a habit to store these things. For content management I use the "Getting Things Done" (GTD) method by David Allen. 
   
<Collapse title="Getting Things Done (GTD) Method">
- **Capture**: Collect everything that has your attention. This can be done through various means such as writing, recording, or using apps.
- **Clarify**: Process what you have captured. Determine what it is, whether it requires action, and if so, what the next steps are.
- **Organize**: Sort the clarified items into appropriate categories. This can include projects, contexts, or areas of focus.
- **Reflect**: Regularly review your lists and projects to ensure you are on track and to update your priorities.
- **Engage**: Use your organized lists to take action on the tasks that are most relevant and important at the moment.
</Collapse>
   
### Capture 
I use a variety of tools to capture my ideas and information. At this point it is a little more manual, and less streamlined than I would Like. 
I plan to overhaul this system in the future, but for now I use a combination of the following tools: Notesnook (Web Clippings), Riverside.fm (Transcripts), 
Obsidian (Notes), Instapaper (Read Later), Zotero (Store Papers), Google Drive (Documents, Spreadsheets, Presentations (and other non-confidential or essential items I plan to review later)).


### Clarify 
I use notion to clarify notes, ideas, concepts, and other information related to the content on this site. I don't have a strict process for doing this. 
I usually organize things simply in small paragraphs, bullet points, or lists.

## Managing My Content 

# Features 

## Magic URLs 
Magic URLs is a feature developed in tandem with [Ally Taffet](https://github.com/allytaffet). magic-urls.js is responsible for 
dynamically generating and managing URLs for various content types on this site. You can view the [source code](), or [writeup](). 

## Automated URL Archiving
Automated URL Archiving is a feature that periodically captures and stores snapshots of web pages linked within the site. 
This ensures that even if the original content is removed or changed, a copy remains accessible. The archiving process is handled by 
[web-archiver.js](), which integrates with various archiving services.

## Settings Menu 
The settings menu is a feature located in the top right corner of the site. It allows users some customization options for their experience. 
- Search: allows users to search for content across the site including pages, papers, essays, blog posts, fiction, reviews, notes, conspiracies, cases, dossiers, scripts, prompts, proofs, and problems.
- Link Preview Mode: enables users to preview links before clicking on them.
- RSS Feed: provides users with a feed of the latest blog posts.
- FAQ: offers answers to frequently asked questions about the site.
- Changelog: displays a log of recent changes and updates to the site.
- Scripts: allows users to manage and customize scripts used on the site.

## Tags, Categories, and Series 
Tags, Categories, and Series are the methods of content organiztation on the site. Tags are the lowest level used for niche associations with 
a post. Such as a post titled "How to Make a Perfect Cup of Coffee" might have tags like "Coffee", "Brewing", "Culinary". While the same post may 
have the category "Beverages". Categories are the next level up, and are used to group content into broader topics. Series are used to group content 
that are related in unusual ways such as all content on "Winona Ryder" which may include reviews of her films, essays a specific performance, or blog posts 
on her career. Series can only be accessed through /series. While tags and categories or type specific and accessed at /[type]/[tags] and /[type]/[categories]. 
For ex. /verse/categories, and /verse/tags. You are also able to swap categories via the category filter on the /[type] page itself. This allows for easier access 
though a bit less granular.


# On Hierarchy 

## Top Level Routes (Types of Content) 
I possess a very experimental mindset, and I like to try new things. This website is a reflection of that. I have strategically designed it to organize content into 
well thought out categories, which I believe will help me to better express my ideas. 
- [Papers](/papers): a collection of well-researched, in-depth articles on various topics. (designed to be more formal, and cited)
- [Essays](/essays): a more personal and reflective form of writing, often exploring complex ideas and arguments.
- [Blog Posts](/blog): shorter, more informal pieces that cover a wide range of topics and are often updated regularly.
- [Fiction](/fiction): creative writing that tells a story, whether it's a short story, novella, or novel.
- [Reviews](/reviews): critical evaluations of various media, including books, movies, and products.
- [Notes](/notes): informal, unpolished thoughts and observations, often serving as a brainstorming space.
- [Conspiracies](/conspiracies): a collection of speculative and often controversial ideas that challenge mainstream narratives.
- [Cases](/cases)
- [Dossiers](/dossiers)
- [Scripts](/scripts)
- [Prompts](/prompts)
- [Proofs](/proofs)
- [Problems](/problems)

## Papers  
Papers/Research Papers are a long form of content. They are entirely for academic purposes, and less public friendly 
than a lot of the other forms of writing on this site. There are tons of types of papers that serve different uses.  
Research Papers should be within 6,000-10,000 words. 
- Research Papers: (often peer-reviewed) present original findings or analyses.
  - Empirical – Based on observation or experiment.
  - Theoretical – Based on theory rather than empirical evidence.
  - Review – Summarizes existing research on a topic.
  - Survey – Collects data from a sample to generalize findings.
  - Case Study – In-depth analysis of a specific case or example.
  - Position Paper – Presents an argument or stance on a particular issue.
- Literature Review
- Case Study
- Position Paper


## Essays

- Expository – Explains or informs.
- Descriptive – Describes a person, place, or event.
- Narrative – Tells a story or recounts events.
- Persuasive / Argumentative – Convince the reader of a viewpoint.
- Analytical – Breaks down a concept or idea into parts.


## Blog Posts
Blog Posts are a more casual form of writing, often shorter and more personal than essays or papers. They usually are on topics that 
cut me deep or are of general personal interest. They often often include examples of the topic at hand using fictional characters, and 
sometimes real people dead or alive. I derive great pleasure from sharing the characters I am interested in, and these are a great way to do so. 
There will also be ton's of rants, ideas, and thoughts on various fields of interest. The length of posts should be greater than 500 words, and less than 1,500 words.
I may also host some long running series here such as the "Meditations", and "Musings" series that focus on personal exploration through philosophy, and spirituallity. 

## Fiction
Fiction is my section for creative writing. Excluding [poetry](), which has its own section. Fiction involves all original works of mine, and 
encompasses a wide range of generes, and styles of interest. 
It is customary for Light Novels to get their own category, but longer form fiction such as Novellas, and Short Stories are grouped by 
format, and kept in a single file. 
- Micro Fiction ( < 300 words )  
- Flash Fiction ( < 1,000 words )  
- Short Stories ( < 7,500 words )  
- Novellas ( < 40,000 words )  
- Light Novels ( < 50,000 words )  
- Creepy Pasta ( < 10,000 words ) - A subgenre of horror fiction that is typically shared online, often in the form of short stories or urban legends.  
- SCP (Secure, Contain, Protect) - A collaborative writing project that creates fictional documents about anomalous objects and entities.  
- Plays (Instead of being a single category, plays are grouped by genere)  
    - Tragedies  
    - Comedies  
    - Dramas  
    - Romances  

# Verse
The verse section is dedicated to only original poetry, and is not a place for prose. Here you will find a wide range of styles, and forms of 
poetry. Anything without strict rhyme, and meter is considered free verse. Most poetry is quite short, and is often less than 500 words. I may at some 
point consider writing a epic poem, but for now I am content with the shorter forms. In the case I do write a epic poem the word limit will be 15,000 words. 
- Free Verse – Poetry that does not follow a specific rhyme or meter.
- Haiku – A traditional Japanese form of poetry consisting of three lines with a 5-7-5 syllable structure.
- Sonnet – A 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme, often written in iambic pentameter.
- Limerick – A humorous five-line poem with a specific rhythm and rhyme scheme (AABBA).
- Villanelle – A 19-line poem with a specific structure and repeating lines.
- Ode – A formal, often ceremonious lyric poem that addresses a particular subject.
- Acrostic – A poem where the first letter of each line spells out a word or message.
- Cinquain – A five-line poem with a specific syllable or word count for each line.
- Tanka – A traditional Japanese form of poetry consisting of five lines with a 5-7-5-7-7 syllable structure.
- Ballad – A narrative poem that tells a story, often set to music.
- Epigram – A brief, witty poem or statement that often conveys a satirical or ironic message.
- Elegy – A mournful poem that reflects on loss or death.
- Ghazal – A form of poetry originating in Arabic literature, consisting of rhyming couplets and a refrain.
- Sestina – A complex form of poetry with a specific pattern of word repetition and structure.
- Cinquain – A five-line poem with a specific syllable or word count for each line.
- Antiphon – A poetic form consisting of a call and response, often used in religious or liturgical contexts.

There will also be some categories for shorter poems named after the stanza type such as couplet, tercet, quatrain, quintain, sestet, ect. 
These are shorter one off poems that are not part of a larger collection, and meant to be practice pieces, or quick thoughts. 

## Reviews
Reviews are a form of writing meant to evaluate, analyze, and critique various forms of media. With reviews I usually try to give 2 ratings   
a enjoyment rating for how much I think the avg consumer will enjoy the piece, and a quality rating for how well I think it was made. Reviews   
can be quite lengthy, and often above 1,000 words. They will be capped at 2,000 words, and sometimes wrote in a more formal style depending on the   
medium being reviewed. I.E. a ballet review will be more formal than a review of a video game.   
  
- Book Reviews - Evaluations of books, including fiction and non-fiction  
- Film Reviews - Critiques of films, no character analysis  
- TV Show Reviews - Analysis of television series, including episodes and seasons

## Notes  
Notes are a form of writing that is meant to be informal, and sometimes unpolished. I also freqently store, and reference some 
unoriginal work here. Such as Nursery Rhymes, Laws of Maat, and other things. 

# Docs 
Docs are PDFs, MP4s, MP3s, Large Text Files, and other Large Files that are often unoriginal, and meant to be used as references for the site. 
Often for papers, essays, and projects. They are hosted on the site, and can be downloaded. They can be accessed through the page itself if you are interested in seeing what is available. 

## Conspiracies  
I am quite interested in conspiracies, how they came about, and the plausibility of those conspiracies even if they do have false conclusions. 
I document them heavy in this section each time I come across new one. I try to keep them objectively factual, and fairly linear in their presentation. 


## Cases  
For those of you that are not aware, I am Web Sleuth and I enjoy solving cases, OSINT, and other types of investigations. I love to contribute where I can, and 
look forward to learning new things about encryption, forensics, cryptography, geography, and other related fields. Any cases I find of active interest will be 
documented here. If I am no longer actively interested in a case I will move it to the [Dossiers](/dossiers) section. [Magic URLs]() will handle the url routing 
regardless of me switching the case to dossier, or back to a case to avoid broken links. 


## Dossiers  
Dossiers are a collection of Case Files. These include formerly active investigations I contributed to in minor or major ways, and cases I have only took a breif interest in 
and decided to document. 


## Proofs  
Proofs are a collection of mathematical proofs. These are strictly original, and often written in LaTeX, so I will probably link the PDF, and LaTeX Full Text version 
in the post. Sometimes I will include formalized proofs in lean4. 


## Problems
For the few of you that may know I previously had a seperate Mathematics Blog. I have since merged it into this site. That left me without some of the 
nice things I had on that site. So I have created a new section for discussing Mathematical Problems such as those found on Math Stack Exchange, Project Euler, 
Math Overflow, Open Problem Garden, and others. This section is meant for me to work through problems, dicuss them, and share my soltuions. If I review someones elses
solution and later give a stab at the problem myself I will include both solutions within the same post. I also took the opportunity to make this section for problems 
overall. So I implemented the same category/tag system as other sections. Enabling me to have section for coding problems, physics problems, riddles, and other types 
of problems. 
  
## Scripts  
Scripts is a collection of the source code for various scripts used on this site, and for adjacent projects. Scripts are primarly written by 
myself, and often include contributions from [Ally Taffet](https://github.com/allytaffet), and [Lydia Lorien](https://github.com/lydialorien).

## Prompts
