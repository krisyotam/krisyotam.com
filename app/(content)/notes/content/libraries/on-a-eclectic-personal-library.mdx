<Box>Many notable books, videos, blog posts, articles, ect. discuss the idea of a personal Library. This one is going to be a little different. 
For starters it is not that I am treating any book(s)/genere(s) with contempt but that due to a very weird concept called **time** I could not

those of a American **middle-class** background. This is what I can best speak to.  </Box>
