<Collapse title="Who is this for?">
This core was specifically designed for myself, or rather the avatar of "Undergrad Pure Mathematics Student with a Poor Foundation". If you feel that you are 
truly struggling in mathematics, and are looking for something slower paced this might not be for you. If you are struggling, and still looking to persevere through a 
more rigirous learning path filled with [Synoptic Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Read_a_Book) on each of the various subjects you are in the right place. Every level here provides just about the most rigirous 
standards for each discipline that myself and the community at large seem to agree upon. If you believe that statement is incorrect for any of the various entries I would love to 
hear your inquiry, and can be reached at krisyotam@protonmail.com

## On the Mathematical Life
It is to the suprise of no one that has put serious effort into the meticulous study of mathematics that the subject requires the balancing of a great deal of temperance, and 
creative thought. I have found that even obsession to a reasonable degree is not enough. One must become immersed in the subject, wholly engaging both mind and faculties in tandem. 
Therefore, and for that cause I recommend my essay [Toward a Mathematical Life](/blog/2025/toward-a-mathematical). A guide into coaxing the unconcious mind into a state of mathematical thought through enviornmental factors, and 
intention. 

## Aspects of Modularity in Structure 
As mentioned above in "Who is this for?". This roadmap was designed for the Undergrad Mathematics Major. So there is to a extend a assumption of 
natural talent, giftedness, perseverance, and/or passion. I suggest that most work through this list linearly as those that are naturally quick to 
mathematical understanding will move through this fairly quickly. I do understand that this is not possible for everyone as you may be in the middle of a semester 
struggling to keep up with your current work. In that case, the structure of this Syllabis was designed in such a modular way that allows for the simultaneous learning 
of several areas. If your goal is to fill in most of the gaps that a poor elementary, middle, and highschool education left you with. Then this is the recommended way. 


## Mathematical History

## Mathematical Writing 
<Box>I first and foremost reccomend that each one of you start a blog. Mathematical Exposition is not in of itself more complex than most other types 
of exposition. It is the dull expositional insticts of one that lend to the difficulty of more formal writing. For that reason I suggest first the reading 
of a series of essays by Terrance Tao with a list of additional essays he reccomends prior to our main curricula here. I will do my best to present them in the 
most logical fashion. </Box>

# On the Beauty of Mathematical Notation

Mathematics is not merely a language—it is a symphony of symbols, a choreography of logic and form. To test the robustness of our `Math` component, we present a flurry of expressions both elementary and esoteric.

Consider the **Pythagorean Theorem** in its most basic form:  
<Math type="inline">a^2 + b^2 = c^2</Math>

## Triple Integrals and Volume

A fundamental result in multivariable calculus is the computation of volume via triple integrals. For a region <Math type="inline">E</Math> in 3D space, the volume is given by:

<Math type="block" tex="\iiint_E f(x, y, z) \, dx\, dy\, dz" />

In spherical coordinates, where <Math type="inline">x = \rho\sin\phi\cos\theta</Math>, <Math type="inline">y = \rho\sin\phi\sin\theta</Math>, and <Math type="inline">z = \rho\cos\phi</Math>, the Jacobian determinant introduces an extra factor of <Math type="inline">\rho^2\sin\phi</Math>. Thus:

<Math type="block" tex="\iiint_E f(\rho, \phi, \theta) \rho^2 \sin\phi \, d\rho\, d\phi\, d\theta" />

## Summation and Limits

The Basel problem, solved by Euler, explores the value of the infinite sum of reciprocals of squares:

<Math type="block" tex="\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}" />

Nested summations can test vertical alignment and large limits:

<Math type="block" tex="\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m a_{ij}b_{ji} = \operatorname{tr}(AB)" />

Or even:

<Math type="block" tex="\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{k} = \ln(2)" />

## Stirling's Approximation and Limits

The behavior of factorials at infinity:

<Math type="block" tex="\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n!}{\sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n} = 1" />

## Fourier Transform

A classic in signal analysis:

<Math type="block" tex="\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x \xi} \, dx" />

And the inverse:

<Math type="block" tex="f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{f}(\xi) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \, d\xi" />

## Dirac Delta Function

In distribution theory:

<Math type="block" tex="\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\delta(x-a)\,dx = f(a)" />

## Gaussian Integral

A gem of analysis:

<Math type="block" tex="\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx = \tfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}" />

## Tensor Notation and Einstein Summation

Stress test with indices:

<Math type="block" tex="T^{\mu\nu} = g^{\mu\alpha}g^{\nu\beta}T_{\alpha\beta}" />

Or an expression involving the Levi-Civita symbol:

<Math type="block" tex="\varepsilon_{ijk}\varepsilon^{lmn} = \det
\begin{bmatrix}
\delta_i^l & \delta_i^m & \delta_i^n \\
\delta_j^l & \delta_j^m & \delta_j^n \\
\delta_k^l & \delta_k^m & \delta_k^n \\
\end{bmatrix}" />

## Conclusion

This post serves both as an ode to the expressive power of mathematics and a rigorous stress test for symbol rendering.

Following our [Series B last December](/2020/next-for-vercel), I'm happy to announce we've raised a [**$102M Series C**](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/vercel-raises-102m-series-c-for-its-next-js-based-front-end-development-platform) from existing and new investors.

Our vision of the Web is a global realtime medium for both creators and consumers,
where all friction and latency are eliminated.

We'll use this investment to:
1. [**Build the SDK for Web**](#next-momentum)
2. [**Lower the barrier of entry**](#realtime)
3. [**Focus on the end-user**](#real)

## 1. Build the SDK for the Web [#next-momentum]

    Next.js continues to grow organically as developers <a href="https://twitter.com/vincentchw/status/1392775589094838277">explain it</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vadim_kravcenko/status/1401937274972037122">recommend it</a> to one another
  </span>}
/>

Unlike other software development platforms, the Web never came with an SDK or Standard Development Kit.

While new browser APIs are constantly being added, the responsibility still falls on the developer to assemble them into an _engine_ for every new project.

The resulting diversity of tools and choices makes the Web the innovative and dynamic
medium that it is, but it can also be a major obstacle, as companies rally 
to reinvent themselves in the digital medium.

React, [now 8 years old](https://reactjs.org/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html), has proven to be a durable abstraction and [building block](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1068183829737664512?lang=en), a narrative violation of the common wisdom that "frontend frameworks are changed every week."

Next.js builds on this formidable foundation to give developers and companies
a meaningful starting point to build great pages, [open sourcing the lessons](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#conformance) learned from the giants of the Web.

## 2. Lower the barrier of entry [#realtime]

Vercel [has](https://twitter.com/bobfmuller/status/1404795808525004805) [given](https://twitter.com/erikras/status/1382420067485417477) [developers](https://twitter.com/otpfy/status/1380458535356669953) access to global infrastructure to
deploy and scale frontend projects. But significant challenges remain to
frictionless collaboration:

- Setting up and maintaining your developer environment
- Integrating it into Git for continuous integration
- Manually pushing and waiting to share progress with your team

Perhaps the most incredible aspect of the Web is that it's not a read-only medium.
Each Web browser is simultaneously the [consumption and creation mechanism](https://twitter.com/sulco/status/1177559150563344384).

With [Next.js Live](https://nextjs.org/live), we want to build a Web that 
everyone can contribute to. Whether it's to pitch in an idea or an edit,
by an experienced developer or a new designer, from a local editor or the
browser itself.

## 3. Focus on the end-user [#real]

<Tweet id="1350618115969789953" />

A particularly interesting challenge of building a platform and tooling 
company is that you have **two users** (whether it's acknowledged or not):

1. The user of the tool
2. The user of the output of the tool

No matter how many downloads Next.js gets, or how delightful and 
realtime the development experience, a universal truth remains: **[the customer is king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_customer_is_always_right)**.

Performance for the end-user has been baked in the design of everything
we make. To name some examples:

- Next.js was born out of the insight that React in its initial Single Page Application presentation was putting the rendering burden on the user's device that should have been on the [server](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components.html) instead. 
- [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics) prioritized giving you a Real Experience Score calculated by each device, rather than just listing traffic stats or TTFB latencies.
- Pre-rendering at build time or via [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/incremental-static-regeneration-nextjs/) is all about [taking the CPU cycles entirely out](/2020/static-hoisting#hoist-to-the-edge) of the page serving equation, removing latency for the end user.

Our primary fitness function is your success for your customers. Not
every visitor might understand fully how every page is built, but if the
experience is delightful and fast, they ought to think it was powered by Vercel.
