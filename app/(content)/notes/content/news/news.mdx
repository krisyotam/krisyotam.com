<Collapse title="Author's Note">
I am at current not particularly interested in news, but I do find it interesting to see how the world has changed over time. I am not a fan of the current state of news including the rise of clickbait, sensationalism, and the decline of journalistic integrity. I prefer to read news from sources that are more focused on facts and less on sensationalism.

I am also fairly strictly against the use of tactics such as fear mongering. I believe that news should be informative and not used to manipulate people into a state of fear or anxiety. For those reasons, I have not been following the news closely and honestly do not plan to do so in the near future. Maybe after gaining so more life stability I will return to it, but at the moment for better or worse I am content to live in my own little world and not worry about the rest of it. 

At a later date I do plan on turning this page into a more comprehensive /news page that will include as exhaustive a list of news sources as I can find per country, well tagged and categorized. I'll also include media bias ratings and other information to help people find news sources that are more aligned with their values and interests. Until then a big thanks to [Cosma](http://bactra.org/news.html) for the inspiration to create this page, as well as the massive starting index of content.

<Excerpt
  title="The Anatomy of Melancholy"
  author="Robert Burton"
  year="1621"
>
I hear new news every day, and those ordinary rumours of war, plagues, fires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets, spectrums, prodigies, apparitions, of towns taken, cities besieged in France, Germany, Turkey, Persia, Poland, &c., daily musters and preparations, and such like, which these tempestuous times afford, battles fought, so many men slain, monomachies, shipwrecks, piracies, and sea-fights, peace, leagues, stratagems, and fresh alarms. A vast confusion of vows, wishes, actions, edicts, petitions, lawsuits, pleas, laws, proclamations, complaints, grievances, are daily brought to our ears. New books every day, pamphlets, currantoes, stories, whole catalogues of volumes of all sorts, new paradoxes, opinions, schisms, heresies, controversies in philosophy, religion, &c. Now come tidings of weddings, maskings, mummeries, entertainments, jubilees, embassies, tilts and tournaments, trophies, triumphs, revels, sports, plays: then again, as in a new shifted scene, treasons, cheating tricks, robberies, enormous villanies in all kinds, funerals, burials, deaths of Princes, new discoveries, expeditions; now comical then tragical matters. To-day we hear of new Lords and officers created, to-morrow of some great men deposed, and then again of fresh honours conferred; one is let loose, another imprisoned; one purchaseth, another breaketh: he thrives, his neighbour turns bankrupt; now plenty, then again dearth and famine; one runs, another rides, wrangles, laughs, weeps &c. Thus I daily hear, and such like, both private and publick news. Amdist the gallantry and misery of the world: jollity, pride, perplexities and cares, simplicity and villany; subtlety, knavery, candour and integrity, mutually mixed and offering themselves, I rub on in a strictly private life; as I have still lived, so I now continue, as I was from the first, left to a solitary life, and mine own domestick discontents: saving that sometimes, not to tell a lie, as Diogenes went into the city, and Democritus to the haven, to see fashions, I did for my recreation now and then walk abroad, look into the world, and could not choose but make some little observation, not so wise an observer as a plain rehearser, not as they did to scoff or laugh at all, but with a mixed passion.
