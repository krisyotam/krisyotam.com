<Box>For the next year of my life most of my development will be in misc obscure projects for this site, random scripts, pen testing, ect. 
However I have recently been thinking a lot on my values, effective altriuism, and software. What domains can I participate in that net the 
most benefit for people.</Box>

# On the Free Software Foundation (FSF), and  GNU/Linux 
Many of my beleifs align with those of Free Software. Mostly those on privacy, anti-surveillance, and anti-censorship. It is honestly not so that I belive a practical 
utopia society in which involved a world where everyone should be able to promote anything they want. It is instead that I do not trust the worlds current gate keepers have 
a sufficient moral compass enough to seperate the weed from the wheat. Furthermore that their is a active persecution of those that stand against the wicked values, and ideas 
propogated by mainstream sources. It is because of this that I believe in the values of Free Software, Free Speech, and Anti-Censorship. For the protection of the good, and not the good of protection.
These beleifs are supported in <Bible>Isa 5:20</Bible>. 

# On Open Source Contributions 



# On Coding Languages 
There are many coding langagues, and learning them is one thing. However learning advanced concepts, features, and project specific style guides is another beast. 
So one of the things I want to do is decide which langagues I think will have the most impact in my lifetime, and focus my efforts on those. Thereby maximizing my impact, 
and the range of my contributions. Currently those I have been pondering on are: 

### C 
It is pretty much already decided that C will be the language I focus on for Low Level Programming, and Operating Systems. I have found this to be the area I could find myself contributing to over the long-term. 
Especially kernal development, such as the Linux Kernal. 

### C++

### Rust

### Haskell

### Python 

### HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
I am not sure what other websites I will be building in the future, especially those that will follow a [long-now]() vision. However I do know that going forward 
I would like to use strictly html, css, and maybe javascript where necessary (though very minimal). I have found that this is the most productive, and enjoyable way to build websites for me 
that are typefont focused, and content heavy. I also hate dependency hell, and the bloat that comes with frameworks. 

### Next.js, React, and Typescript 
for krisyotam.com I use Next.js, and Typescript. I have found it to be the most productive, and enjoyable way to scale this project, and plan on the continued use of it for the forseeable future. 

# On my Philosophy for Coding Contributions 

# On My Coding Style 
I have a very specific coding style that I like to follow for each Language I use. A lot of it hinges on the Suckless philosophy. A lot of it will also tend to be heavily suited to what I use 
the language for, and the types of projects I work on. I will likely store the style guides for projects I plan to work on long-term [here](/docs) in the future.
