# About My Logo

<Dropcap type="william-morris-gothic">I</Dropcap> have got several questions on my logo, and the various symbols involved in it. How it came to be, and what it represents. This page is dedicated to explaining the design, symbolism, 
and creation of my personal logo. This logo is a personal crest that was designed to represent my identity, and values. It is not just a visual mark, but a narrative that encapsulates who I am and what I stand for.
The key visual elements of the logo are blue delphiniums, blue hydrangea, chinese blue wisteria, callery pears, 4 doves, 2 crossing keys, star of david, and a rainbow. On a ribbon at the bottom is printed 
"Lux et Veritas" which is latin for "Light and Truth". Below this is my name "Kris Yotam".

# On Blue Delphiniums
Delphiniums, or "Larkspur", symbolize protection, cheerfulness, and goodwill. "Blue delphiniums" specifically represent dignity, and respect. 

# On Blue Hydrangea
Blue Hydrangeas symbolize gratitude, understanding, and forgiveness. 

# On Chinese Blue Wisteria
Wisteria represents longevity, and wisdom due to their long lifespan of over 100 years. They also symbolize romance, prosperity, and wealth. 

# On Callery Pears
Callery pears, also known as Bradford Pears, symbolize resilience. They are known for their beautiful white flowers in spring. Which is what made me initially fall in love with them. 
They are actually a invasive species in many parts of the world, and are not traditionally considered a desireble tree. However when I look at the callery pear what often comes to mind 
is

# On the 4 Doves
Doves represent peace, purity, and divine presence. The number of them is also not accidental. 4 cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west representing a sense of completeness. The 4s dual meaning is that evocative of the 4 gospels: matthew, mark, luke, and john.

# On the 2 Crossing Keys
The 2 keys represent the keys of "Hell, and Death" mentioned in <Bible>Rev 1:18</Bible>. The 4 squares on each key can be represented numerologically as stability, practicality, and hard work. Associated with Christ overcoming Hell (torment), and Death. 

# On the Star of David
The Star of David, or "Magen David" in Hebrew, is a biblical symbol. six points of the star symbolize the six days of creation, with the center representing the Sabbath, a day of rest and spiritual reflection.

# On the Rainbow
The rainbow is a symbol of hope, promise, and divine covenant. It represents God's promise to never again flood the earth, as mentioned in <Bible>Genesis 9:13-17</Bible>. 

# Lux et Veritas
"Lux et Veritas" is a Latin phrase meaning "Light and Truth". It reflects my purpose in life to seek and share knowledge, wisdom, and enlightenment. The light here is a reference to 
Christ, who is on several occasions is referred to as the light of the world. Here are some references to this in scripture: <Bible>John 1:4, John 1:5, John 1:9, John 3:19, John 8:12, John 9:5, John 12:35, John 12:36, John 12:46</Bible>
The Truth is a reference to what Christ represented, and what he taught. The Law of God, or the "[Mitzvah](/mitzvah)" in Hebrew. According to <Bible>Ecclesiastes 12:13</Bible>, the whole duty of man is to "Fear God, and keep his commandments".
