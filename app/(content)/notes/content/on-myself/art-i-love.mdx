<Box>Unlike [anime](/anime), [manga](/manga), [games](/games), [reading](/reading), [film](/film) and [music](/music) I don't currently have a page to showcase my love of art. As [art](/art) is 
currently and permenantly reserved for the display of my own art as I learn. So this page is just that. A page dedicated to the showcasing of my favorite art, and artists both classical, and contemporary. </Box>
