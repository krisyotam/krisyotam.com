# Personal Axioms

Core principles that guide my decisions and worldview. These are the foundational beliefs I return to when facing uncertainty or complexity.

## On Learning & Growth

**Embrace beginner's mind**: Every expert was once a beginner. Approach new domains with curiosity rather than the need to appear knowledgeable.

**Learn by building**: Understanding comes through creation, not consumption. The best way to learn something is to try to make it.

**Seek disconfirming evidence**: Actively look for information that challenges your beliefs. Being wrong quickly is better than being wrong for a long time.

**Questions > Answers**: The quality of your questions determines the quality of your thinking. Good questions are more valuable than clever answers.

## On Work & Purpose

**Optimize for learning over earning**: Early in your career, choose opportunities that teach you the most. Skills compound faster than salary.

**Do things that don't scale**: The most valuable work often can't be automated or systematized. Embrace the inefficient and personal.

**Default to action**: When in doubt, do something. Imperfect action beats perfect inaction every time.

**Build things people want**: The market is the ultimate judge of value. Build for real people with real problems.

## On Relationships & Communication

**Assume positive intent**: Most conflicts arise from misunderstanding rather than malice. Start with curiosity, not judgment.

**Be specific with praise, general with criticism**: "You did X well" is more helpful than "You're good at this." "This could be better" is kinder than "You did Y wrong."

**Listen to understand, not to reply**: The goal of conversation is connection, not winning. Seek to understand before seeking to be understood.

**Show up consistently**: Reliability is a form of respect. Small, consistent actions build stronger relationships than grand gestures.

## On Decision Making

**Choose reversible decisions quickly**: Most decisions are two-way doors. Make them fast and change course if needed.

**Optimize for optionality**: When uncertain, choose paths that keep more doors open rather than closing them.

**Focus on inputs, not outcomes**: You can't control results, but you can control effort, process, and choices.

**When in doubt, choose the harder path**: Easy choices often lead to hard lives. Hard choices often lead to easy lives.

## On Technology & Progress

**Tools amplify intent**: Technology magnifies whatever you were already doing. If you were distracted before, it will make you more distracted.

**Simple beats complex**: The best solutions are often the simplest ones. Complexity is easy; simplicity is hard.

**Local first, cloud second**: Control your own data and tools when possible. The cloud is just someone else's computer.

**Build for humans**: Technology should serve human needs, not the other way around. If it makes life worse, it's bad technology.

## On Money & Resources

**Time is the ultimate currency**: You can make more money, but you can't make more time. Spend it intentionally.

**Enough is a decision**: Wealth is not an amount of money; it's when you have enough. Decide what "enough" means for you.

**Invest in yourself first**: The best investment is developing skills that can't be taken away from you.

**Money follows value**: Focus on creating value for others, and money will follow. Chase money directly, and it becomes elusive.

## On Health & Well-being

**Sleep is not optional**: Almost every problem is worse when you're tired. Prioritize sleep above almost everything else.

**Move every day**: The human body is designed for movement. Find ways to move that you enjoy, not endure.

**Mental health is health**: Taking care of your mind is as important as taking care of your body. Both require attention and maintenance.

**Stress is information**: Anxiety and stress are signals, not just problems to eliminate. Listen to what they're telling you.

## On Personal Philosophy

**Progress over perfection**: Done is better than perfect. Perfect is often the enemy of good enough.

**Embrace uncertainty**: Life is fundamentally uncertain. Learn to be comfortable with not knowing.

**You are not your thoughts**: You have thoughts; you are not your thoughts. Observe them without being controlled by them.

**Everything is temporary**: Both good times and bad times pass. This perspective brings gratitude in success and hope in failure.

*These axioms are not universal truths but personal operating principles. They've served me well, but your mileage may vary.*
