<Box>This is a post idea taken from [gwern](https://gwern.net/improvement). The idea is to list 
improvements to ordinary quality-of-life going beyond computers.</Box>

<Collapse title="What are improvements?">Improvements are those concious and unconcious things that you look back on and go 
"wow im glad that changed", or "What the hell did I do before this?".</Collapse>

Improvements

Divided by year, and in reverse chronological order. 

# 2025 
- Overcame the fear of annotating books. I now buy [Oxford World Classics](https://global.oup.com/academic/content/series/o/oxford-worlds-classics-owc/?cc=us&lang=en&), or [Penguin Classics](https://www.penguin.com/penguin-classics-overview/), and annotate them with a [Muji 0.38mm](https://www.muji.us/products/gel-ink-cap-type-ballpoint-pen-0-38mm-8a63). 
    - I use a [Midori MD Notebook A5](https://md.midori-japan.co.jp/en/products/mdnote/) to track my ideas, and thoughts. 
    - I use my phone camera to take pictures of the annotations, and upload them to [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) which are analyzed via [this prompt](/prompts/transcript-book-notes-gpt4o.txt). 
- I deep research EVERYTHING I buy with GPT-o4mini-High, to avoid switching later. 
    - Prompt can be [found here](/prompts/novice-deep-research-04mini-high.txt)
- I learned how to read a book, [framework here](/blog/2025/on-better-reading/). [Book Notes Here](/blog/2025/how-to-read-a-book). 

# 2024
- Switched to plastic ware for plates, bowls, and utensils. I keep a couple of [knives](https://shun.kaiusa.com/), and a Hydroflask for drinking. 
- Stopped Paying for Crunchyroll, and Netflix. Opting for free alternatives such as [AniCli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli), and [Soap2Day](https://ww25.soap2day.day/).
