<Collapse title="What is this?">
This page tracks the software, hardware, and peripherals I use in reverseâ€‘chronological order.
Inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com/). I've swapped setups quite a bit over the years as 
my focus for them changed. I'll try to shed some light on that as well.

<Box>During this year I have been focused on the clarification of my life. Living with intention, and the minimalizing of things it takes to do that. For the 
rest of this year I will actively be testing out more minimal setups often outsourcing compute to my [server]().</Box>
