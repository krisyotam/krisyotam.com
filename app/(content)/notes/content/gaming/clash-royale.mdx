# Profiles 
I have had tons of accounts over the years, but these are the ones I currently use, and still have access to. I won't list tags for obvious reasons. 
You also won't see any of my old accounts here, as I have lost access to them, or they are no longer active. I will try to update this section with some of the names as 
I recover screenshots, or find them in my old emails. It is also worth noting I have been a account pusher in the past, and have pushed several accounts to the top 200 across the years. 
I will not list any of the accounts pushed to the top 200 that are not mine on. I would also like to mention that several of these accounts were banned due to "Account Sharing", and I have not since 
broken the terms of Service, and never on any of the accounts listed here. Also note that several of my accounts have had several past names that I keep a private list of. I have not always used my real first name 
as a public account username. This is a more recent trend of mine specifically for brand consistency across dozens of platforms.

<Collapse title="Ranked Finishes">
Like I said I won't be revealing what accounts I pushed but at least 2 of these important finishes were actually on my own account. So should not be that difficult to find 
considering that all leaderboards in history are public knowledge. (Do not email me asking for accounts, I will not give them out, and I will not tell you whcich accounts I have pushed to the top 200, or top 1000)
- Top 200 Ladder Finishes: #98, #160, #223, #246, #697, #2582  
    Top Ranked Finishes: #1324, #1655, #6088

# Decks
I'll try to scrape through screenshots, and my forsaken memory to conjure up some of the decks in these categories. I'll also recreate them on deckshop, and link them

# Hours Invested 
Here is a quantitative look at how much time I have spent playing Clash Royale across all alive accounts (including estimated fill ins for alt accounts). 
Now for some accounts I have not been the sole owner, and I have not played on them for the entire time they were alive. I will do my best to provie several estimates. 
The raw total unmodified version. The modified version where I will attempt to trim the hours to what is a reasonable estimate of how much time I myself have spent.

# Money Invested
Yikes this would have definitely been better spent elsewhere, but I did it anyway.
