The Original Eliza program, created by Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s, was a pioneering example of natural language processing. It simulated a conversation with a psychotherapist, using pattern matching to respond to user input. 
The program's simplicity and effectiveness sparked discussions about the potential of AI in human-computer 
interaction.
