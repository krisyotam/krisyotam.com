Oh spring of youth, it is your warm-  
Warm waters that cleanse my soul.  
Let the tall caverns that surround  
you blot out the light— so that my eyes  
may rest from fatigue. Let the steam  
abound and hide my face. In respite—  
I collapse so that my left is hidden from my right.  
The warmth leaves scare residue  
on my mind— minding of how I was conceived  
It be my desire that warm—  
Warm waters be the way I cease to be.
