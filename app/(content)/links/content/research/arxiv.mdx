## arXiv

arXiv (pronounced "archive") is an open-access repository of electronic preprints and postprints approved for posting after moderation, but not full peer review. It consists of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, electrical engineering, systems science, and economics.

### History

arXiv was founded by physicist Paul Ginsparg in 1991 as an alternative to the slow process of publishing in academic journals. Initially, it was hosted at Los Alamos National Laboratory and known as the LANL preprint archive.

### Impact

arXiv has revolutionized scientific publishing by:

- Allowing rapid dissemination of research findings
- Providing open access to scientific knowledge
- Enabling researchers in developing countries to stay current with research
- Creating a permanent record of scientific communication

### Usage

As of 2023, arXiv hosts over 2 million scholarly articles, with more than 16,000 new submissions each month. It receives millions of downloads per week, demonstrating its central role in scientific communication.

### How to Use

1. **Browse**: Articles can be searched by subject area or specific keywords
2. **Download**: Papers are available in PDF, PostScript, and other formats
3. **Submit**: Researchers can submit their own papers after registration
4. **Subscribe**: Users can receive daily or weekly alerts about new submissions in their fields of interest

arXiv has become indispensable for researchers across multiple disciplines, particularly in physics and mathematics where it's often the first place new research appears.
