## Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg is a volunteer effort to digitize, archive, and distribute cultural works, particularly books in the public domain. Founded by Michael Hart in 1971, it is the oldest digital library and one of the most significant repositories of freely available literature.

### History

Project Gutenberg began when Michael Hart was given access to significant computing time at the University of Illinois. He decided to use this opportunity to create something of enduring value and typed the Declaration of Independence into the computer, making it the first e-book. This pioneering act established Hart's vision of making literature freely available in electronic format.

### Collection

The Project Gutenberg collection has grown substantially since its inception:

- **Over 60,000 free ebooks** in various formats
- **Multiple languages** with a focus on Western literature
- **Complete works** of Shakespeare, Dickens, Austen, and other major authors
