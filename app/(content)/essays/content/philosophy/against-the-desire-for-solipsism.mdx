# Defining Solipsim 
However selfless the actions of an individual seem, as long as they physically, emotionally, or even intangibly offer benefit to self, they cannot be 
considered such. For an act to be Selfless it must be devoid of self; therefore, only actions which are diametrically opposed to the will of the person performing them can be considered selfless acts.
This is not to condemn selfish acts, as I myself believe that self-interest, when correctly aligned, is the highest interest. Take example I, 
where a mother has the choice between feeding a random child and her own, knowing that one of them will die of starvation. In this situation, 
it is right that a mother should take interest in feeding her child—an extension of herself—in alignment with her will for preservation of self.
The problem with this definition is that it relies on a single solid-state will, when instead will is hierarchical—a taxonomy of priority. Let us 
take Yeshua at Gethsemane in <Bible>Matthew 26:39</Bible>. He asks, “Let this cup of suffering be taken away from me,” and in the same sentence says, 
“Yet I want your will to be done, not mine.” It is here where I would like to separate Primary Desire from Higher-Order Desire. This allows for a 
consolidation in our definition: any act of will that is Higher Order, and in diametric opposition to one’s primary will, is against the self-interest 
of a person and thus qualifies as a selfless act by my more rigorous definition.
