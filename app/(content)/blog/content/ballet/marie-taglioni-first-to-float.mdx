# About Me
Marie Taglioni, Comtesse de Voisins (23 April 1804 – 22 April 1884) was a Swedish-born ballet dancer of the Romantic ballet 
era partially of Italian descent, a central figure in the history of European dance. She spent most of her life in the Austrian 
Empire and France. She was one of the most celebrated ballerinas of the romantic ballet, which was cultivated primarily at Her 
Majesty's Theatre in London and at the Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique of the Paris Opera Ballet. She is credited with 
(though not confirmed as) being the first ballerina to truly dance en pointe. Marie Taglioni, Comtesse de Voisins (23 April 1804 – 22 April 1884) was a Swedish-born ballet dancer of the Romantic ballet
