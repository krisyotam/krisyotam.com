# Select Elementary Improper Integrals I

This is a curated set of challenging improper integrals that appear elementary but require subtle techniques. These integrals showcase the beauty and complexity that can arise in real analysis.

## Problem Set

### Problem 1: Classic Logarithmic Integral

Evaluate:
$$\int_0^1 \frac{\ln(1+x)}{x} \, dx$$

**Hint**: Consider the series expansion of $\ln(1+x)$.

### Problem 2: Trigonometric Challenge

Compute:
$$\int_0^{\pi/2} \ln(\sin x) \, dx$$

**Hint**: This integral has a beautiful connection to the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

### Problem 3: Gaussian-Related Integral

Find:
$$\int_0^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \cos(2ax) \, dx$$

where $a$ is a real parameter.

### Problem 4: Hyperbolic Functions

Evaluate:
$$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sinh(ax)}{\sinh(\pi x)} \, dx$$

for $0 < a < \pi$.
